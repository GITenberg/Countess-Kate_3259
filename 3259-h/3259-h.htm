<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span>, I&rsquo;ve done every
bit I can do!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to see what o&rsquo;clock it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it strike eleven just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, you&rsquo;ll tip up!&nbsp; What a tremendous
stretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-ooh!&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
get one moment before dinner!&nbsp; Oh, horrible! oh, horrible!
most horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, you know I hate hearing <i>Hamlet</i>
profaned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hate it more than having no one to hear
our lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes you do it.&nbsp; What on earth can Mary be
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some tiresome woman to speak to her, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it can&rsquo;t be as much her business
as it is to mind her poor little sisters.&nbsp; Oh dear! if Papa
could only afford us a governess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I should not like it at all; besides, it is
wrong to wish to be richer than one is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish; I am only thinking how nice it
would be, if some one would give us a famous quantity of
money.&nbsp; Then Papa should have a pretty parsonage, like the
one at Shagton; and we would make the church beautiful, and get
another pony or two, to ride with Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and have a garden with a hothouse like Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; and a governess to teach us to draw.&nbsp; But
best of all&mdash;O Sylvia! wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice not to have
to mind one&rsquo;s clothes always?&nbsp; Yes, you laugh; but it
comes easier to you; and, oh dear! oh dear! it is so horrid to be
always having to see one does not tear oneself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do see,&rdquo; said Sylvia,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My frocks always <i>will</i> get upon the thorns.&nbsp;
It is very odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only do please, Katie dear, let me finish this sum; and
then if Mary is not come, she can&rsquo;t scold if we are amusing
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll draw
such a picture, and tell you all about it when your sum is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereon ensued silence in the little room, half parlour, half
study, nearly filled with books and piano; and the furniture,
though carefully protected with brown holland, looking the worse
for wear, and as if danced over by a good many young folks.</p>
<p>The two little girls, who sat on the opposite sides of a
little square table in the bay-window, were both between ten and
eleven years old, but could not have been taken for twins, nor
even for sisters, so unlike were their features and complexion;
though their dress, very dark grey linsey, and brown holland
aprons, was exactly the same, except that Sylvia&rsquo;s was
enlivened by scarlet braid, Kate&rsquo;s darkened by
black&mdash;and moreover, Kate&rsquo;s apron was soiled, and the
frock bore traces of a great darn.&nbsp; In fact, new frocks for
the pair were generally made necessary by Kate&rsquo;s tattered
state, when Sylvia&rsquo;s garments were still available for
little Lily, or for some school child.</p>
<p>Sylvia&rsquo;s brown hair was smooth as satin; Kate&rsquo;s
net did not succeed in confining the loose rough waves of dark
chestnut, on the road to blackness.&nbsp; Sylvia was the shorter,
firmer, and stronger, with round white well-cushioned limbs; Kate
was tall, skinny, and brown, though perfectly healthful.&nbsp;
The face of the one was round and rosy, of the other thin and
dark; and one pair of eyes were of honest grey, while the others
were large and hazel, with blue whites.&nbsp; Kate&rsquo;s little
hand was so slight, that Sylvia&rsquo;s strong fingers could
almost crush it together, but it was far less effective in any
sort of handiwork; and her slim neatly-made foot always was a
reproach to her for making such boisterous steps, and wearing out
her shoes so much faster than the quieter movements of her
companion did&mdash;her sister, as the children would have said,
for nothing but the difference of surname reminded Katharine
Umfraville that she was not the sister of Sylvia Wardour.</p>
<p>Her father, a young clergyman, had died before she could
remember anything, and her mother had not survived him three
months.&nbsp; Little Kate had then become the charge of her
mother&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Wardour, and had grown up in the
little parsonage belonging to the district church of St.
James&rsquo;s, Oldburgh, amongst her cousins, calling Mr. and
Mrs. Wardour Papa and Mamma, and feeling no difference between
their love to their own five children and to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wardour had been dead for about four years, and the
little girls were taught by the eldest sister, Mary, who had been
at a boarding-school to fit her for educating them.&nbsp; Mr.
Wardour too taught them a good deal himself, and had the more
time for them since Charlie, the youngest boy, had gone every day
to the grammar-school in the town.</p>
<p>Armyn, the eldest of the family, was with Mr. Brown, a very
good old solicitor, who, besides his office in Oldburgh, had a
very pretty house and grounds two miles beyond St. James&rsquo;s,
where the parsonage children were delighted to spend an afternoon
now and then.</p>
<p>Little did they know that it was the taking the little niece
as a daughter that had made it needful to make Armyn enter on a
profession at once, instead of going to the university and
becoming a clergyman like his father; nor how cheerfully Armyn
had agreed to do whatever would best lighten his father&rsquo;s
cares and troubles.&nbsp; They were a very happy family; above
all, on the Saturday evenings and Sundays that the good-natured
elder brother spent at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, laying down her slate
pencil, and indulging in another tremendous yawn; &ldquo;we
can&rsquo;t do a thing more till Mary comes!&nbsp; What can she
be about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but look, Sylvia!&rdquo; cried Kate, quite
forgetting everything in the interest of her drawing on a large
sheet of straw-paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you see what it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sylvia,
&ldquo;unless&mdash;let me see&mdash;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a very
rich little girl, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; pointing to an outline
of a young lady whose wealth was denoted by the flounces (or
rather scallops) on her frock, the bracelets on her
sausage-shaped arms, and the necklace on her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she is a very rich and grand&mdash;&nbsp; Lady
Ethelinda; isn&rsquo;t that a pretty name?&nbsp; I do wish I was
Lady Katharine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is she giving?&nbsp; I wish you would not do
men and boys, Kate; their legs always look so funny as you do
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never will come right; but never mind, I must have
them.&nbsp; That is Lady Ethelinda&rsquo;s dear good cousin,
Maximilian; he is a lawyer&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see the
parchment sticking out of his pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Armyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is giving him a box with a beautiful new
microscope in it; don&rsquo;t you see the top of it?&nbsp; And
there is a whole pile of books.&nbsp; And I would draw a pony,
only I never can nicely; but look here,&rdquo;&mdash;Kate went on
drawing as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;here is Lady Ethelinda with her
best hat on, and a little girl coming.&nbsp; There is the little
girl&rsquo;s house, burnt down; don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia saw with the eyes of her mind the ruins, though her
real eyes saw nothing but two lines, meant to be upright, joined
together by a wild zig-zag, and with some peaked scrabbles and
round whirls intended for smoke.&nbsp; Then Kate&rsquo;s ready
pencil portrayed the family, as jagged in their drapery as the
flames and presently Lady Ethelinda appeared before a counter
(such a counter! sloping like a desk in the attempt at
perspective, but it conveniently concealed the shopman&rsquo;s
legs,) buying very peculiar garments for the sufferers.&nbsp;
Another scene in which she was presenting them followed, Sylvia
looking on, and making suggestions; for in fact there was no
quiet pastime more relished by the two cousins than drawing
stories, as they called it, and most of their pence went in paper
for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Ethelinda had a whole ream of paper to draw
on!&rdquo; were the words pronounced in Kate&rsquo;s shrill key
of eagerness, just as the long lost Mary and her father opened
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, a tall, grave-looking
man; &ldquo;and who is Lady Ethelinda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Papa, it&rsquo;s just a story I was drawing,&rdquo;
said Kate, half eager, half ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have done all the lessons we could, indeed we
have&mdash;&rdquo; began Sylvia; &ldquo;my music and our French
grammar, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Mary; and she paused, looking
embarrassed and uncomfortable, so that Sylvia stood in suspense
and wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so my little Kate likes thinking of Lady&mdash;Lady
Etheldredas,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour rather musingly; but Kate
was too much pleased at his giving any sort of heed to her
performances to note the manner, and needed no more encouragement
to set her tongue off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Ethelinda, Papa.&nbsp; She is a very grand rich
lady, though she is a little girl: and see there, she is giving
presents to all her cousins; and there she is buying new clothes
for the orphans that were burnt out; and there she is building a
school for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate suddenly stopped, for Mr. Wardour sat down, drew her
between his knees, took both her hands into one of his, and
looked earnestly into her face, so gravely that she grew
frightened, and looking appealingly up, cried out, &ldquo;O Mary,
Mary! have I been naughty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour; &ldquo;but we
have heard a very strange piece of news about you, and I am very
anxious as to whether it may turn out for your
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stood still and looked at him, wishing he would speak
faster.&nbsp; Could her great-uncle in India be come home, and
want her to make him a visit in London?&nbsp; How
delightful!&nbsp; If it had been anybody but Papa, she would have
said, &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour at last, &ldquo;you
know that your cousin, Lord Caergwent, was killed by an accident
last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;that was why Mary
made me put this black braid on my frock; and a very horrid job
it was to do&mdash;it made my fingers so sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know till this morning that his death would
make any other difference to you,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Wardour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought the title went to heirs-male, and
that Colonel Umfraville was the present earl; but, my little
Katharine, I find that it is ordained that you should have this
great responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you thought it was the Salic law?&rdquo; said
Kate, going on with one part of his speech, and not quite
attending to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like it; only that it is not the English term
for it,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, half smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
your grandfather was the elder son, the title and property come
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did not look at him, but appeared intent on the marks of
the needle on the end of her forefinger, holding down her
head.</p>
<p>Sylvia, however, seemed to jump in her very skin, and opening
her eyes, cried out, &ldquo;The title!&nbsp; Then Kate
is&mdash;is&mdash;oh, what is a she-earl called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A countess,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, with a smile, but
rather sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our little Kate is Countess of
Caergwent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sylvia!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary in amazement; for
Sylvia, like an India-rubber ball, had bounded sheer over the
little arm-chair by which she was standing.</p>
<p>But there her father&rsquo;s look and uplifted finger kept her
still and silent.&nbsp; He wanted to give Kate time to understand
what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Countess of Caergwent,&rdquo; she repeated;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not so pretty as if I were Lady
Katharine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sound does not matter much,&rdquo; said Mary.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will always be Katharine to those that love you
best.&nbsp; And oh!&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mary stopped short, her
eyes full of tears.</p>
<p>Kate looked up at her, astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you sorry,
Mary?&rdquo; she asked, a little hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all sorry to lose our little Kate,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wardour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose me, Papa!&rdquo; cried Kate, clinging to him, as
the children scarcely ever did, for he seldom made many caresses;
&ldquo;Oh no, never!&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t Caergwent Castle belong
to me?&nbsp; Then you must all come and live with me there; and
you shall have lots of big books, Papa; and we will have a
pony-carriage for Mary, and ponies for Sylvia and Charlie and me,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate either ran herself down, or saw that the melancholy look
on Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s face rather deepened than lessened, for
she stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I have both
other duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but if I built a church!&nbsp; I dare say there are
people at Caergwent as poor as they are here.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t we build a church, and you mind them,
Papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Katharine, you have yet to understand that
&lsquo;the heir, so long as he is a child, differeth in nothing
from a servant, but is under tutors and governors.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You will not have any power over yourself or your property till
you are twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are my tutor and my governor, and my spiritual
pastor and master,&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always say so
whenever Mary asks us questions about our duty to our
neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been so hitherto,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour,
setting her on his knee; &ldquo;but I see I must explain a good
deal to you.&nbsp; It is the business of a court in London, that
is called the Court of Chancery, to provide that proper care is
taken of young heirs and heiresses and their estates, if no one
have been appointed by their parents to do so; and it is this
court that must settle what is to become of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why won&rsquo;t it settle that I may live with my
own papa and brothers and sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Kate, you must be brought up in a way to fit
your station; and my children must be brought up in a way to fit
theirs.&nbsp; And besides,&rdquo; he added more sadly,
&ldquo;nobody that could help it would leave a girl to be brought
up in a household without a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart said directly, that as she could never
again have a mother, her dear Mary must be better than a
stranger; but somehow any reference to the sorrow of the
household always made her anxious to get away from the subject,
so she looked at her finger again, and asked, &ldquo;Then am I to
live up in this Court of Chances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
two aunts in London, Lady Barbara and Lady Jane Umfraville, are
kind enough to offer to take charge of you.&nbsp; Here is a
letter that they sent inclosed for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Countess of Caergwent,&rdquo; was written on the
envelope; and Kate&rsquo;s and Sylvia&rsquo;s heads were together
in a moment to see how it looked, before opening the letter, and
reading:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Niece,&rsquo;&mdash;dear me,
how funny to say niece!&mdash;&lsquo;I deferred writing to you
upon the melancholy&mdash;&rsquo; oh, what is it,
Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The melancholy comet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melancholy event,&rdquo; suggested Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think why grown-up
people always write on purpose for one not to read
them.&mdash;&lsquo;Melancholy event that has placed you in
possession of the horrors of the family.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrors!&mdash;Kate, Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sure it <i>is</i> horrors,&rdquo; said the
little girl rather perversely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a time for nonsense, Kate,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wardour; and she was subdued directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I read it to you?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo;&nbsp; Kate was too proud of her
letter to give it up, and applied herself to it
again.&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Family honours, until I could
ascertain your present address.&nbsp; And likewise, the shock of
your poor cousin&rsquo;s death so seriously affected my
sister&rsquo;s health in her delicate state, that for some days I
could give my attention to nothing else.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dear
me!&nbsp; This is my Aunt Barbara, I see!&nbsp; Is Aunt Jane so
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has had very bad health for many years,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wardour; &ldquo;and your other aunt has taken the greatest
care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have now, however, been able to consider what
will be best for all parties; and we think nothing will be so
proper as that you should reside with us for the present.&nbsp;
We will endeavour to make a happy home for you; and will engage a
lady to superintend your education, and give you all the
advantages to which you are entitled.&nbsp; We have already had
an interview with a very admirable person, who will come down to
Oldburgh with our butler next Friday, and escort you to us, if
Mrs. Wardour will kindly prepare you for the journey.&nbsp; I
have written to thank her for her kindness to
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wardour!&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ladies have known and cared little about Kate or us
for a good many years,&rdquo; said Mary, almost to herself, but
in such a hurt tone, that her father looked up with grave reproof
in his eyes, as if to remind her of all he had been saying to her
during the long hours that the little girls had waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With your Aunt Jane&rsquo;s love, and hoping
shortly to be better acquainted, I remain, my dear little niece,
your affectionate aunt, Barbara Umfraville.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I
am to go and live with them!&rdquo; said Kate, drawing a long
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Papa, do let Sylvia come too, and learn of
my governess with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunts do not exactly contemplate that,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wardour; &ldquo;but perhaps there may be visits between
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia began to look very grave.&nbsp; She had not understood
that this great news was to lead to nothing but separation.&nbsp;
Everything had hitherto been in common between her and Kate, and
that what was good for the one should not be good for the other
was so new and strange, that she did not understand it at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! we will visit.&nbsp; You shall all come and see
me in London, and see the Zoological Gardens and the British
Museum; and I will send you such presents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour kindly; &ldquo;but
just now, I think the best thing you can do is to write to your
aunt, and thank her for her kind letter; and say that I will
bring you up to London on the day she names, without troubling
the governess and the butler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be near so much afraid if you come with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour left the room; and the first thing Mary did was to
throw her arms round the little girl in a long vehement
embrace.&nbsp; &ldquo;My little Kate! my little Kate!&nbsp; I
little thought this was to be the end of it!&rdquo; she cried,
kissing her, while the tears dropped fast.</p>
<p>Kate did not like it at all.&nbsp; The sight of strong feeling
distressed her, and made her awkward and ungracious.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mary,&rdquo; she said, disengaging herself;
&ldquo;never mind; I shall always come and see you; and when I
grow up, you shall come to live with me at Caergwent.&nbsp; And
you know, when they write a big red book about me, they will put
in that you brought me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write a big red book about you, Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Kate, suddenly become very learned,
&ldquo;there is an immense fat red and gold book at Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s, all full of Lords and Ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a Peerage!&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but even you,
my Lady Countess, can&rsquo;t have a whole peerage to
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that little laugh seemed to do Mary good, for she rose and
began to rule the single lines for Kate&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
Kate could write a very tidy little note; but just now she was
too much elated and excited to sit down quietly, or quite to know
what she was about.&nbsp; She went skipping restlessly about from
one chair to another, chattering fast about what she would do,
and wondering what the aunts would be like, and what Armyn would
say, and what Charlie would say, and the watch she would buy for
Charlie, and the great things she was to do for
everybody&mdash;till Mary muttered something in haste, and ran
out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Mary is so cross,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>Poor Mary!&nbsp; No one could be farther from being cross; but
she was thoroughly upset.&nbsp; She was as fond of Kate as of her
own sisters, and was not only sorry to part with her, but was
afraid that she would not be happy or good in the new life before
her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days passed very slowly with
Kate, until the moment when she was to go to London and take her
state upon her, as she thought.&nbsp; Till that should come to
pass, she could not feel herself really a countess.&nbsp; She did
not find herself any taller or grander; Charlie teased her rather
more instead of less and she did not think either Mr. Wardour or
Mary or Armyn thought half enough of her dignity: they did not
scruple to set her down when she talked too loud, and looked sad
instead of pleased when she chattered about the fine things she
should do.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Brown, to be sure, came to wish her
good-bye; but they were so respectful, and took such pains that
she should walk first, that she grew shy and sheepish, and did
not like it at all.</p>
<p>She thought ease and dignity would come by nature when she was
once in London; and she made so certain of soon seeing Sylvia
again, that she did not much concern herself about the parting
with her; while she was rather displeased with Mary for looking
grave, and not making more of her, and trying to tell her that
all might not be as delightful as she expected.&nbsp; She little
knew that Mary was grieved at her eagerness to leave her happy
home, and never guessed at the kind sister&rsquo;s fears for her
happiness.&nbsp; She set it all down to what she was wont to call
crossness.&nbsp; If Mary had really been a cross or selfish
person, all she would have thought of would have been that now
there would not be so many rents to mend after Kate&rsquo;s
cobbling attempts, nor so many shrill shrieking laughs to disturb
Papa writing his sermon, nor so much difficulty in keeping any
room in the house tidy, nor so much pinching in the
housekeeping.&nbsp; Instead of that, Mary only thought whether
Barbara and Lady Jane would make her little Kate happy and
good.&nbsp; She was sure they were proud, hard, cold people; and
her father had many talks with her, to try to comfort her about
them.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour told her that Kate&rsquo;s grandfather had been
such a grief and shame to the family, that it was no wonder they
had not liked to be friendly with those he had left behind
him.&nbsp; There had been help given to educate the son, and some
notice had been taken of him, but always very distant; and he had
been thought very foolish for marrying when he was very young,
and very ill off.&nbsp; At the time of his death, his uncle,
Colonel Umfraville, had been very kind, and had consulted
earnestly with Mr. Wardour what was best for the little orphan;
but had then explained that he and his wife could not take charge
of her, because his regiment was going to India, and she could
not go there with them; and that his sisters were prevented from
undertaking the care of so young a child by the bad health of the
elder, who almost owed her life to the tender nursing of the
younger.&nbsp; And as Mrs. Wardour was only eager to keep to
herself all that was left of her only sister, and had a nursery
of her own, it had been most natural that Kate should remain at
St. James&rsquo;s Parsonage; and Mr. Wardour had full reason to
believe that, had there been any need, or if he had asked for
help, the aunts would have gladly given it.&nbsp; He knew them to
be worthy and religious women; and he told Mary that he thought
it very likely that they might deal better with Kate&rsquo;s
character than he had been able to do.&nbsp; Mary knew she
herself had made mistakes, but she could not be humble for her
father, or think any place more improving than under his
roof.</p>
<p>And Kate meanwhile had her own views.&nbsp; And when all the
good-byes were over, and she sat by the window of the railway
carriage, watching the fields rush by, reduced to silence,
because &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; had told her he could not hear her
voice, and had made a peremptory sign to her when she screamed
her loudest, and caused their fellow-travellers to look up
amazed, she wove a web in her brain something like
this:&mdash;&ldquo;I know what my aunts will be like: they will
be just like ladies in a book.&nbsp; They will be dreadfully
fashionable!&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;Aunt Barbara will have a
turban on her head, and a bird of paradise, like the bad old lady
in Armyn&rsquo;s book that Mary took away from me; and they will
do nothing all day long but try on flounced gowns, and count
their jewels, and go out to balls and operas&mdash;and they will
want me to do the same&mdash;and play at cards all Sunday!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lady Caergwent,&rsquo; they will say, &lsquo;it is
becoming to your position!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the young
countess presented a remarkable contrast in her ingenuous
simplicity,&rdquo; continued Kate, not quite knowing whether she
was making a story or thinking of herself&mdash;for indeed she
did not feel as if she were herself, but somebody in a
story.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her waving hair was only confined by an azure
ribbon, (Kate loved a fine word when Charlie did not hear it to
laugh at her;) and her dress was of the simplest muslin, with one
diamond aigrette of priceless value!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had not the most remote notion what an aigrette might be,
but she thought it would sound well for a countess; and she went
on musing very pleasantly on the amiable simplicity of the
countess, and the speech that was to cure the aunts of playing at
cards on a Sunday, wearing turbans, and all other enormities, and
lead them to live in the country, giving a continual course of
school feasts, and surprising meritorious families with gifts of
cows.&nbsp; She only wished she had a pencil to draw it all to
show Sylvia, provided Sylvia would know her cows from her
tables.</p>
<p>After more vain attempts at chatter, and various stops at
stations, Mr. Wardour bought a story-book for her; and thus
brought her to a most happy state of silent content, which lasted
till the house roofs of London began to rise on either side of
the railway.</p>
<p>Among the carriages that were waiting at the terminus was a
small brougham, very neat and shiny; and a servant came up and
touched his hat, opening the door for Kate, who was told to sit
there while the servant and Mr. Wardour looked for the
luggage.&nbsp; She was a little disappointed.&nbsp; She had once
seen a carriage go by with four horses, and a single one did not
seem at all worthy of her; but she had two chapters more of her
story to read, and was so eager to see the end of it, that Mr.
Wardour could hardly persuade her to look out and see the Thames
when she passed over it, nor the Houses of Parliament and the
towers of Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>At last, while passing through the brighter and more crowded
streets, Kate having satisfied herself what had become of the
personages of her story, looked up, and saw nothing but dull
houses of blackened cream colour; and presently found the
carriage stopping at the door of one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it here, Papa?&rdquo; she said, suddenly seized with
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Bruton
Street;&rdquo; and he looked at her anxiously as the door was
opened and the steps were let down.&nbsp; She took tight hold of
his hand.&nbsp; Whatever she had been in her day-dreams, she was
only his own little frightened Kate now; and she tried to shrink
behind him as the footman preceded them up the stairs, and
opening the door, announced&mdash;&ldquo;Lady Caergwent and Mr.
Wardour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two ladies rose up, and came forward to meet her.&nbsp; She
felt herself kissed by both, and heard greetings, but did not
know what to say, and stood up by Mr. Wardour, hanging down her
head, and trying to stand upon one foot with the other, as she
always did when she was shy and awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, my dear,&rdquo; said one of the ladies,
making a place for her on the sofa.&nbsp; But Kate only laid hold
of a chair, pulled it as close to Mr. Wardour as possible, and
sat down on the extreme corner of it, feeling for a rail on which
to set her feet, and failing to find one, twining her ankles
round the leg of the chair.&nbsp; She knew very well that this
was not pretty; but she never could recollect what was pretty
behaviour when she was shy.&nbsp; She was a very different little
girl in a day-dream and out of one.&nbsp; And when one of the
aunts asked her if she were tired, all she could do was to give a
foolish sort of smile, and say, &ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she had a perception that Papa was looking reprovingly at
her; so she wriggled her legs away from that of the chair,
twisted them together in the middle, and said something meant for
&ldquo;No, thank you;&rdquo; but of which nothing was to be heard
but &ldquo;q,&rdquo; apparently proceeding out of the brim of her
broad hat, so low did the young countess, in her amiable
simplicity, hold her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is shy!&rdquo; said one of the ladies to the other;
and they let her alone a little, and began to talk to Mr. Wardour
about the journey, and various other things, to which Kate did
not greatly listen.&nbsp; She began to let her eyes come out from
under her hat brim, and satisfied herself that the aunts
certainly did not wear either turbans or birds of paradise, but
looked quite as like other people as she felt herself, in spite
of her title.</p>
<p>Indeed, one aunt had nothing on her head at all but a little
black velvet and lace, not much more than Mary sometimes wore,
and the other only a very light cap.&nbsp; Kate thought
great-aunts must be as old at least as Mrs. Brown, and was much
astonished to see that these ladies had no air of age about
them.&nbsp; The one who sat on the sofa had a plump, smooth,
pretty, pink and white face, very soft and pleasant to look at,
though an older person than Kate would have perceived that the
youthful delicacy of the complexion showed that she had been
carefully shut up and sheltered from all exposure and exertion,
and that the quiet innocent look of the small features was that
of a person who had never had to use her goodness more actively
than a little baby.&nbsp; Kate was sure that this was aunt Jane,
and that she should get on well with her, though that slow way of
speaking was rather wearisome.</p>
<p>The other aunt, who was talking the most, was quite as slim as
Mary, and had a bright dark complexion, so that if Kate had not
seen some shades of grey in her black hair, it would have been
hard to believe her old at all.&nbsp; She had a face that put
Kate in mind of a picture of a beautiful lady in a book at
home&mdash;the eyes, forehead, nose, and shape of the chin, were
so finely made; and yet there was something in them that made the
little girl afraid, and feel as if the plaster cast of
Diana&rsquo;s head on the study mantelpiece had got a pair of
dark eyes, and was looking very hard at her; and there was a sort
of dry sound in her voice that was uncomfortable to hear.</p>
<p>Then Kate took a survey of the room, which was very prettily
furnished, with quantities of beautiful work of all kinds, and
little tables and brackets covered with little devices in china
and curiosities under glass, and had flowers standing in the
windows; and by the time she had finished trying to make out the
subject of a print on the walls, she heard some words that made
her think that her aunts were talking of her new governess, and
she opened her ears to hear, &ldquo;So we thought it would be an
excellent arrangement for her, poor thing!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; answering, &ldquo;I hope Kate may try to be a
kind considerate pupil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then seeing by Kate&rsquo;s
eyes that her attention had been astray, or that she had not
understood Lady Barbara&rsquo;s words, he turned to her, saying,
&ldquo;Did you not hear what your aunt was telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was telling me about the lady who will teach
you.&nbsp; She has had great afflictions.&nbsp; She has lost her
husband, and is obliged to go out as governess, that she may be
able to send her sons to school.&nbsp; So, Kate, you must think
of this, and try to give her as little trouble as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have been much nicer if Kate would have looked up
readily, and said something kind and friendly; but the fit of
awkwardness had come over her again, and with it a thought so
selfish, that it can hardly be called otherwise than
naughty&mdash;namely, that grown-up people in trouble were very
tiresome, and never let young ones have any fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I take you to see Mrs. Lacy, my dear?&rdquo; said
Lady Barbara, rising.&nbsp; And as Kate took hold of Mr.
Wardour&rsquo;s hand, she added, &ldquo;You will see Mr. Wardour
again after dinner.&nbsp; You had better dress, and have some
meat for your tea, with Mrs. Lacy, and then come into the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a stroke upon Kate.&nbsp; She who had dined with the
rest of the world ever since she could remember&mdash;she, now
that she was a countess, to be made to drink tea up-stairs like a
baby, and lose all that time of Papa&rsquo;s company!&nbsp; She
swelled with displeasure: but Aunt Barbara did not look like a
person whose orders could be questioned, and &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;
said not a word in her favour.&nbsp; Possibly the specimen of
manners she had just given had not led either him or Lady Barbara
to think her fit for a late dinner.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara first took her up-stairs, and showed her a little
long narrow bed-room, with a pretty pink-curtained bed in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be your room, my dear,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sorry we have not a larger one to offer you; but it
opens into mine, as you see, and my sister&rsquo;s is just
beyond.&nbsp; Our maid will dress you for a few days, when I hope
to engage one for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was something like promotion!&nbsp; Kate dearly loved to
have herself taken off her own hands, and not to be reproved by
Mary for untidiness, or roughly set to rights by Lily&rsquo;s
nurse.&nbsp; She actually exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, thank
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And her aunt waited till the hat and cloak had
been taken off and the chestnut hair smoothed, looked at her
attentively, and said, &ldquo;Yes, you are like the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very like my own papa,&rdquo; said Kate,
growing a little bolder, but still speaking with her head on one
side, which was her way when she said anything sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are,&rdquo; answered her aunt, with the
dry sound.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you ready now?&nbsp; I will show you
the way.&nbsp; The house is very small,&rdquo; continued Lady
Barbara, as they went down the stairs to the ground floor;
&ldquo;and this must be your school-room for the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the room under the back drawing-room; and in it was a
lady in a widow&rsquo;s cap, sitting at work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
is your little Pupil&mdash;Lady Caergwent&mdash;Mrs. Lacy,&rdquo;
said Lady Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you will find her a good
child.&nbsp; She will drink tea with you, and then dress, and
afterwards I hope, we shall see you with her in the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lacy bowed, without any answer in words, only she took
Kate&rsquo;s hand and kissed her.&nbsp; Lady Barbara left them,
and there was a little pause.&nbsp; Kate looked at her governess,
and her heart sank, for it was the very saddest face she had ever
seen&mdash;the eyes looked soft and gentle, but as if they had
wept till they could weep no longer; and when the question was
asked, &ldquo;Are you tired, my dear?&rdquo; it was in a sunk
tone, trying to be cheerful but the sadder for that very
reason.&nbsp; Poor lady! it was only that morning that she had
parted with her son, and had gone away from the home where she
had lived with her husband and children.</p>
<p>Kate was almost distressed; yet she felt more at her ease than
with her aunts, and answered, &ldquo;Not at all, thank
you,&rdquo; in her natural tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a long journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had been silent so long, that her tongue was ready for
exertion; and she began to chatter forth all the events of the
journey, without heeding much whether she were listened to or
not, till having come to the end of her breath, she saw that Mrs.
Lacy was leaning back in her chair, her eyes fixed as if her
attention had gone away.&nbsp; Kate thereupon roamed round the
room, peeped from the window and saw that it looked into a dull
black-looking narrow garden, and then studied the things in the
room.&nbsp; There was a piano, at which she shook her head.&nbsp;
Mary had tried to teach her music; but after a daily fret for six
weeks, Mr. Wardour had said it was waste of time and temper for
both; and Kate was delighted.&nbsp; Then she came to a book-case;
and there the aunts had kindly placed the books of their own
younger days, some of which she had never seen before.&nbsp; When
she had once begun on the &ldquo;Rival Crusoes,&rdquo; she gave
Mrs. Lacy no more trouble, except to rouse her from it to drink
her tea, and then go and be dressed.</p>
<p>The maid managed the white muslin so as to make her look very
nice; but before she had gone half way down-stairs, there was a
voice behind&mdash;&ldquo;My Lady! my Lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not turn, not remembering that she herself must be
meant; and the maid, running after her, caught her rather
sharply, and showed her her own hand, all black and grimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How tiresome!&rdquo; cried she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I
only just washed it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lady; but you took hold of the balusters all
the way down.&nbsp; And your forehead!&nbsp; Bless me! what would
Lady Barbara say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Kate had been trying to peep through the balusters into
the hall below, and had of course painted her brow with London
blacks.&nbsp; She made one of her little impatient gestures, and
thought she was very hardly used&mdash;dirt stuck upon her, and
brambles tore her like no one else.</p>
<p>She got safely down this time, and went into the drawing-room
with Mrs. Lacy, there taking a voyage of discovery among the
pretty things, knowing she must not touch, but asking endless
questions, some of which Mrs. Lacy answered in her sad
indifferent way, others she could not answer, and Kate was rather
vexed at her not seeming to care to know.&nbsp; Kate had not yet
any notion of caring for other people&rsquo;s spirits and
feelings; she never knew what to do for them, and so tried to
forget all about them.</p>
<p>The aunts came in, and with them Mr. Wardour.&nbsp; She was
glad to run up to him, and drag him to look at a group in white
Parian under a glass, that had delighted her very much.&nbsp; She
knew it was Jupiter&rsquo;s Eagle; but who was feeding it?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ganymede,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour; and Kate, who always
liked mythological stories, went on most eagerly talking about
the legend of the youth who was borne away to be the cup-bearer
of the gods.&nbsp; It was a thing to make her forget about the
aunts and everybody else; and Mr. Wardour helped her out, as he
generally did when her talk was neither foolish nor ill-timed but
he checked her when he thought she was running on too long, and
went himself to talk to Mrs. Lacy, while Kate was obliged to come
to her aunts, and stood nearest to Lady Jane, of whom she was
least afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem quite at home with all the heathen gods, my
dear,&rdquo; said Lady Jane; &ldquo;how come you to know them so
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Charlie&rsquo;s lesson-books, you know,&rdquo; said
Kate; and seeing that her aunt did not know, she went on to say,
&ldquo;there are notes and explanations.&nbsp; And there is a
Homer&mdash;an English one, you know; and we play at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to have quite a learned lady here!&rdquo; said
aunt Barbara, in the voice Kate did not like.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
learn music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t got any ear; and I hate
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lady Barbara drily; and Kate seeing Mr.
Wardour&rsquo;s eyes fixed on her rather anxiously, recollected
that hate was not a proper word, and fell into confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And drawing?&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I want to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; again said Lady Barbara, looking at
Kate&rsquo;s fingers, which in her awkwardness she was apparently
dislocating in a method peculiar to herself.</p>
<p>However, it was soon over, for it was already later than
Kate&rsquo;s home bed-time; she bade everyone good-night, and was
soon waited on by Mrs. Bartley, the maid, in her own luxurious
little room.</p>
<p>But luxurious as it was, Kate for the first time thoroughly
missed home.&nbsp; The boarded floor, the old crib, the deal
table, would have been welcome, if only Sylvia had been
there.&nbsp; She had never gone to bed without Sylvia in her
life.&nbsp; And now she thought with a pang that Sylvia was
longing for her, and looking at her empty crib, thinking too, it
might be, that Kate had cared more for her grandeur than for the
parting.</p>
<p>Not only was it sorrowful to be lonely, but also Kate was one
of the silly little girls, to whom the first quarter of an hour
in bed was a time of fright.&nbsp; Sylvia had no fears, and
always accounted for the odd noises and strange sights that
terrified her companion.&nbsp; She never believed that the house
was on fire, even though the moon made very bright sparkles; she
always said the sounds were the servants, the wind, or the mice;
and never would allow that thieves would steal little girls, or
anything belonging to themselves.&nbsp; Or if she were fast
asleep, her very presence gave a feeling of protection.</p>
<p>But when the preparations were very nearly over, and Kate
began to think of the strange room, and the roar of carriages in
the streets sounded so unnatural, her heart failed her, and the
fear of being alone quite overpowered her dread of the grave
staid Mrs. Bartley, far more of being thought a silly little
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please please, Mrs. Bartley,&rdquo; she said in a
trembling voice, &ldquo;are you going away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lady; I am going down to supper, when I have
placed my Lady Jane&rsquo;s and my Lady Barbara&rsquo;s
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please&mdash;please,&rdquo; said Kate, in her most
humble and insinuating voice, &ldquo;do leave the door open while
you are doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my Lady,&rdquo; was the answer, in a tone
just like that in which Lady Barbara said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the door stayed open; but Kate could not sleep.&nbsp;
There seemed to be the rattle and bump of the train going on in
her bed; the gas-lights in the streets below came in unnaturally,
and the noises were much more frightful and unaccountable than
any she had ever heard at home.&nbsp; Her eyes spread with
fright, instead of closing in sleep; then came the longing
yearning for Sylvia, and tears grew hot in them; and by the time
Mrs. Bartley had finished her preparations, and gone down, her
distress had grown so unbearable, that she absolutely began
sobbing aloud, and screaming, &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;&nbsp; She knew
he would be very angry, and that she should hear that such folly
was shameful in a girl of her age; but any anger would be better
than this dreadful loneliness.&nbsp; She screamed louder and
louder; and she grew half frightened, half relieved, when she
heard his step, and a buzz of voices on the stairs; and then
there he was, standing by her, and saying gravely, &ldquo;What is
the matter, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Papa, Papa, I want&mdash;I want Sylvia!&mdash;I am
afraid!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she held her breath, and cowered under
the clothes, ready for a scolding; but it was not his angry
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; he said quietly and
sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must put away this childishness, my
dear.&nbsp; You know that you are not really alone, even in a
strange place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Papa; but I am afraid&mdash;I cannot bear
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you said the verse that helps you to bear it,
Katie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not say it without Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard him sigh; and then he said, &ldquo;You must try
another night, my Katie, and think of Sylvia saying it at home in
her own room.&nbsp; You will meet her prayers in that way.&nbsp;
Now let me hear you say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate repeated, but half choked with sobs, &ldquo;I lay me down
in peace,&rdquo; and the rest of the calm words, with which she
had been taught to lay herself in bed; but at the end she cried,
&ldquo;O Papa, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, my dear: I cannot stay away from your
aunts.&nbsp; But I will tell you what to do to-night, and other
nights when I shall be away: say to yourself the ninety-first
Psalm.&nbsp; I think you know it&mdash;&lsquo;Whoso abideth under
the defence of the Most High&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to say it to yourself, and then the place will seem
less dreary, because you will feel Who is with you.&nbsp; I will
look in once more before I go away, and I think you will be
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though Kate tried to stay awake for him, asleep she
was.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a very few days, Kate had been
settled into the ways of the household in Bruton Street; and
found one day so like another, that she sometimes asked herself
whether she had not been living there years instead of days.</p>
<p>She was always to be ready by half-past seven.&nbsp; Her
French maid, Josephine, used to come in at seven, and wash and
dress her quietly, for if there were any noise Aunt Barbara would
knock and be displeased.&nbsp; Aunt Barbara rose long before that
time, but she feared lest Aunt Jane should be disturbed in her
morning&rsquo;s sleep; and Kate thought she had the ears of a
dragon for the least sound of voice or laugh.</p>
<p>At half-past seven, Kate met Mrs. Lacy in the school-room,
read the Psalms and Second Lesson, and learnt some answers to
questions on the Catechism, to be repeated to Lady Barbara on a
Sunday.&nbsp; For so far from playing at cards in a
bird-of-paradise turban all Sunday, the aunts were quite as
particular about these things as Mr. Wardour&mdash;more
inconveniently so, the countess thought; for he always let her
answer his examinations out of her own head, and never gave her
answers to learn by heart; &ldquo;Answers that I know before
quite well,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;only not made tiresome with
fine words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not a right way of talking, Lady
Caergwent,&rdquo; gravely said Mrs. Lacy; and Kate gave herself
an ill-tempered wriggle, and felt cross and rebellious.</p>
<p>It was a trial; but if Kate had taken it humbly, she would
have found that even the stiff hard words and set phrases gave
accuracy to her ideas; and the learning of the texts quoted would
have been clear gain, if she had been in a meeker spirit.</p>
<p>This done, Mrs. Lacy gave her a music-lesson.&nbsp; This was
grievous work, for the question was not how the learning should
be managed, but whether the thing should be learnt at all.</p>
<p>Kate had struggled hard against it.&nbsp; She informed her
aunts that Mary had tried to teach her for six weeks in vain, and
that she had had a bad mark every day; that Papa had said it was
all nonsense, and that talents could not be forced; and that
Armyn said she had no more ear than an old pea-hen.</p>
<p>To which Lady Barbara had gravely answered, that Mr. Wardour
could decide as he pleased while Katharine was under his charge,
but that it would be highly improper that she should not learn
the accomplishments of her station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only I can&rsquo;t learn,&rdquo; said Kate, half
desperate; &ldquo;you will see that it is no use, Aunt
Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do my duty, Katharine,&rdquo; was all the
answer she obtained; and she pinched her chair with suppressed
passion.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara was right in saying that it was her duty to see
that the child under her charge learnt what is usually expected
of ladies; and though Kate could never acquire music enough to
give pleasure to others, yet the training and discipline were
likely not only to improve her ear and untamed voice, but to be
good for her whole character&mdash;that is, if she had made a
good use of them.&nbsp; But in these times, being usually already
out of temper with the difficult answers of the Catechism
questions, and obliged to keep in her pettish feelings towards
what concerned sacred things, she let all out in the music
lesson, and with her murmurs and her inattention, her yawns and
her blunders, rendered herself infinitely more dull and unmusical
than nature had made her, and was a grievous torment to poor Mrs.
Lacy, and her patient, &ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;now, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate thought it was Mrs. Lacy who tormented her!&nbsp; I
wonder which was the worse to the other!&nbsp; At any rate, Mrs.
Lacy&rsquo;s heavy eyes looked heavier, and she moved as though
wearied out for the whole day by the time the clock struck nine,
and released them; whilst her pupil, who never was cross long
together, took a hop, skip, and jump, to the dining-room, and was
as fresh as ever in the eager hope that the post would bring a
letter from home.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara read prayers in the dining-room at nine, and
there breakfasted with Kate and Mrs. Lacy, sending up a tray to
Lady Jane in her bed-room.&nbsp; Those were apt to be grave
breakfasts; not like the merry mornings at home, when chatter
used to go on in half whispers between the younger ones, with
laughs, breaking out in sudden gusts, till a little over-loudness
brought one of Mary&rsquo;s good-natured &ldquo;Hushes,&rdquo;
usually answered with, &ldquo;O Mary, such fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Lady Barbara&rsquo;s time for asking about all the
lessons of the day before; and though these were usually fairly
done, and Mrs. Lacy was always a kind reporter, it was rather
awful; and what was worse, were the strictures on
deportment.&nbsp; For it must be confessed, that Lady Caergwent,
though neatly and prettily made, with delicate little feet and
hands, and a strong upright back, was a remarkably awkward child;
and the more she was lectured, the more ungraceful she made
herself&mdash;partly from thinking about it, and from fright
making her abrupt, partly from being provoked.&nbsp; She had
never been so ungainly at Oldburgh; she never was half so awkward
in the school-room, as she would be while taking her cup of tea
from Lady Barbara, or handing the butter to her governess.&nbsp;
And was it not wretched to be ordered to do it again, and again,
and again, (each time worse than the last&mdash;the fingers more
crooked, the elbow more stuck out, the shoulder more forward than
before), when there was a letter in Sylvia&rsquo;s writing lying
on the table unopened?</p>
<p>And whereas it had been the fashion at St. James&rsquo;s
Parsonage to compare Kate&rsquo;s handing her plate to a
chimpanzee asking for nuts, it was hard that in Bruton Street
these manners should be attributed to the barbarous country in
which she had grown up!&nbsp; But that, though Kate did not know
it, was very much her own fault.&nbsp; She could never be found
fault with but she answered again.&nbsp; She had been scarcely
broken of replying and justifying herself, even to Mr. Wardour,
and had often argued with Mary till he came in and put a sudden
sharp stop to it; and now she usually defended herself with
&ldquo;Papa says&mdash;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mary says&mdash;&rdquo;
and though she really thought she spoke the truth, she made them
say such odd things, that it was no wonder Lady Barbara thought
they had very queer notions of education, and that her niece had
nothing to do but to unlearn their lessons.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katharine, easy-chairs were not meant for little girls
to lounge in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa says he doesn&rsquo;t want one always to sit
upright and stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Lady Barbara was left to suppose that Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s
model attitude for young ladies was sitting upon one leg in an
easy-chair, with the other foot dangling, the forehead against
the back, and the arm of the chair used as a desk!&nbsp; How was
she to know that this only meant that he had once had the
misfortune to express his disapproval of the high-backed
long-legged school-room chairs formerly in fashion?&nbsp; In
fact, Kate could hardly be forbidden anything without her
replying that Papa or Mary <i>always</i> let her do it; till at
last she was ordered, very decidedly, never again to quote Mr.
and Miss Wardour, and especially not to call him Papa.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s eyes flashed at this; and she was so angry, that
no words would come but a passionate stammering &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t leave off; I
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barbara looked stern and grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be
taught what is suitable to your position, Lady Caergwent; and
until you have learnt to feel it yourself, I shall request Mrs.
Lacy to give you an additional lesson every time you call Mr.
Wardour by that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s low slow way of speaking when in great
displeasure was a terrific thing, and so was the set look of her
handsome mouth and eyes.&nbsp; Kate burst into a violent fit of
crying, and was sent away in dire disgrace.&nbsp; When she had
spent her tears and sobs, she began to think over her
aunt&rsquo;s cruelty and ingratitude, and the wickedness of
trying to make her ungrateful too; and she composed a thrilling
speech, as she called it&mdash;&ldquo;Lady Barbara Umfraville,
when the orphan was poor and neglected, my Uncle Wardour was a
true father to me.&nbsp; You may tear me with wild horses ere I
will cease to give him the title of&mdash;&nbsp; No; and I will
call him papa&mdash;no, father&mdash;with my last
breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the countess might have done if Lady Barbara had torn her
with wild horses must remain uncertain.&nbsp; It is quite certain
that the mere fixing of those great dark eyes was sufficient to
cut off Pa&mdash;at its first syllable, and turn it into a
faltering &ldquo;my uncle;&rdquo; and that, though Kate&rsquo;s
heart was very sore and angry, she never, except once or twice
when the word slipped out by chance, incurred the penalty, though
she would have respected herself more if she had been brave
enough to bear something for the sake of showing her love to Mr.
Wardour.</p>
<p>And the fact was, that self-justification and carelessness of
exact correctness of truth had brought all this upon her, and
given her aunt this bad opinion of her friends!</p>
<p>But this is going a long way from the description of
Kate&rsquo;s days in Bruton Street.</p>
<p>After breakfast, she was sent out with Mrs. Lacy for a
walk.&nbsp; If she had a letter from home, she read it while
Josephine dressed her as if she had been a doll; or else she had
a story book in hand, and was usually lost in it when Mrs. Lacy
looked into her room to see if she were ready.</p>
<p>To walk along the dull street, and pace round and round the
gardens in Berkeley Square, was not so entertaining as morning
games in the garden with Sylvia; and these were times of feeling
very like a prisoner.&nbsp; Other children in the gardens seemed
to be friends, and played together; but this the aunts had
forbidden her, and she could only look on, and think of Sylvia
and Charlie, and feel as if one real game of play would do her
all the good in the world.</p>
<p>To be sure she could talk to Mrs. Lacy, and tell her about
Sylvia, and deliver opinions upon the characters in her histories
and stories; but it often happened that the low grave &ldquo;Yes,
my dear,&rdquo; showed by the very tone that her governess had
heard not a word; and at the best, it was dreary work to look up
and discourse to nothing but the black crape veil that Mrs. Lacy
always kept down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think why I should have a governess in
affliction; it is very hard upon me!&rdquo; said Kate to
herself.</p>
<p>Why did she never bethink herself how hard the afflictions
were upon Mrs. Lacy, and what good it would have done her if her
pupil had tried to be like a gentle little daughter to her,
instead of merely striving for all the fun she could get?</p>
<p>The lesson time followed.&nbsp; Kate first repeated what she
had learnt the day before; and then had a French master two days
in the week; on two more, one for arithmetic and geography; and
on the other two, a drawing master.&nbsp; She liked these
lessons, and did well in all, as soon as she left off citing Mary
Wardour&rsquo;s pronunciations, and ways of doing sums.&nbsp;
Indeed, she had more lively conversation with her French master,
who was a very good-natured old man, than with anyone else,
except Josephine; and she liked writing French letters for him to
correct, making them be from the imaginary little girls whom she
was so fond of drawing, and sending them to Sylvia.</p>
<p>After the master was gone, Kate prepared for him for the next
day, and did a little Italian reading with Mrs. Lacy; after which
followed reading of history, and needle-work.&nbsp; Lady Barbara
was very particular that she should learn to work well, and was a
good deal shocked at her very poor performances.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
had thought that plain needle-work, at least, would be taught in
a clergyman&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary tried to teach me; but she says all my fingers are
thumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so poor Mrs. Lacy found them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lacy and her pupil dined at the ladies&rsquo; luncheon;
and this was pleasanter than the breakfast, from the presence of
Aunt Jane, whose kiss of greeting was a comforting cheering
moment, and who always was so much distressed and hurt at the
sight of her sister&rsquo;s displeasure, that Aunt Barbara seldom
reproved before her.&nbsp; She always had a kind word to say;
Mrs. Lacy seemed brighter and less oppressed in the sound of her
voice; everyone was more at ease; and when speaking to her, or
waiting upon her, Lady Barbara was no longer stern in manner nor
dry in voice.&nbsp; The meal was not lively; there was nothing
like the talk about parish matters, nor the jokes that she was
used to; and though she was helped first, and ceremoniously
waited on, she might not speak unless she was spoken to; and was
it not very cruel, first to make everything so dull that no one
could help yawning, and then to treat a yawn as a dire
offence?</p>
<p>The length of the luncheon was a great infliction, because all
the time from that to three o&rsquo;clock was her own.&nbsp; It
was a poor remnant of the entire afternoons which she and Sylvia
had usually disposed of much as they pleased; and even what there
was of it, was not to be spent in the way for which the young
limbs longed.&nbsp; No one was likely to play at blind
man&rsquo;s buff and hare and hounds in that house; and even her
poor attempt at throwing her gloves or a pen-wiper against the
wall, and catching them in the rebound, and her scampers
up-stairs two steps at once, and runs down with a leap down the
last four steps, were summarily stopped, as unladylike, and too
noisy for Aunt Jane.&nbsp; Kate did get a private run and leap
whenever she could, but never with a safe conscience; and that
spoilt the pleasure, or made it guilty and alarmed.</p>
<p>All she could do really in peace was reading or drawing, or
writing letters to Sylvia.&nbsp; Nobody had interfered with any
of these occupations, though Kate knew that none of them were
perfectly agreeable to Aunt Barbara, who had been heard to speak
of children&rsquo;s reading far too many silly story-books
now-a-days, and had declared that the child would cramp her hand
for writing or good drawing with that nonsense.</p>
<p>However, Lady Jane had several times submitted most
complacently to have a whole long history in pictures explained
to her, smiling very kindly, but not apparently much the
wiser.&nbsp; And one, at least, of the old visions of wealth was
fulfilled, for Kate&rsquo;s pocket-money enabled her to keep
herself in story-books and unlimited white paper, as well as to
set up a paint-box with real good colours.&nbsp; But somehow, a
new tale every week had not half the zest that stories had when a
fresh book only came into the house by rare and much prized
chances; and though the paper was smooth, and the blue and red
lovely, it was not half so nice to draw and paint as with Sylvia
helping, and the remains of Mary&rsquo;s rubbings for making
illuminations; nay, Lily spoiling everything, and Armyn and
Charlie laughing at her were now remembered as ingredients in her
pleasure; and she would hardly have had the heart to go on
drawing but that she could still send her pictorial stories to
Sylvia, and receive remarks on them.&nbsp; There were no more
Lady Ethelindas in flounces in Kate&rsquo;s drawings now; her
heroines were always clergymen&rsquo;s daughters, or those of
colonists cutting down trees and making the butter.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the carriage came to the door; and on
Mondays and Thursdays took Lady Caergwent and her governess to a
mistress who taught dancing and calisthenic exercises, and to
whom her aunts trusted to make her a little more like a countess
than she was at present.&nbsp; Those were poor Kate&rsquo;s black
days of the week; when her feet were pinched, and her arms turned
the wrong way, as it seemed to her; and she was in perpetual
disgrace.&nbsp; And oh, that polite disgrace!&nbsp; Those wishes
that her Ladyship would assume a more aristocratic deportment,
were so infinitely worse than a good scolding!&nbsp; Nothing
could make it more dreadful, except Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s coming
in at the end to see how she was getting on.</p>
<p>The aunts, when Lady Jane was well enough, used to take their
drive while the dancing lesson was in progress, and send the
carriage afterwards to bring their niece home.&nbsp; On the other
days of the week, when it was fine, the carriage set Mrs. Lacy
and Kate down in Hyde Park for their walk, while the aunts drove
about; and this, after the first novelty, was nearly as dull as
the morning walk.&nbsp; The quiet decorous pacing along was very
tiresome after skipping in the lanes at home; and once, when Mrs.
Lacy had let her run freely in Kensington Gardens, Lady Barbara
was much displeased with her, and said Lady Caergwent was too old
for such habits.</p>
<p>There was no sight-seeing.&nbsp; Kate had told Lady Jane how
much she wished to see the Zoological Gardens and British Museum,
and had been answered that some day when she was very good Aunt
Barbara would take her there; but the day never came, though
whenever Kate had been in no particular scrape for a little
while, she hoped it was coming.&nbsp; Though certainly days
without scrapes were not many: the loud tones, the screams of
laughing that betrayed her undignified play with Josephine, the
attitudes, the skipping and jumping like the gambols of a calf,
the wonderful tendency of her clothes to get into
mischief&mdash;all were continually bringing trouble upon
her.</p>
<p>If a splash of mud was in the street, it always came on her
stockings; her meals left reminiscences on all her newest
dresses; her hat was always blowing off; and her skirts curiously
entangled themselves in rails and balusters, caught upon nails,
and tore into ribbons; and though all the repairs fell to
Josephine&rsquo;s lot, and the purchase of new garments was no
such difficulty as of old, Aunt Barbara was even more severe on
such mishaps than Mary, who had all the trouble and expense of
them.</p>
<p>After the walk, Kate had lessons to learn for the next
day&mdash;poetry, dates, grammar, and the like; and after them
came her tea; and then her evening toilette, when, as the aunts
were out of hearing, she refreshed herself with play and chatter
with Josephine.&nbsp; She was supposed to talk French to her; but
it was very odd sort of French, and Josephine did not insist on
its being better.&nbsp; She was very good-natured, and thought
&ldquo;Miladi&rdquo; had a dull life; so she allowed a good many
things that a more thoughtful person would have known to be
inconsistent with obedience to Lady Barbara.</p>
<p>When dressed, Kate had to descend to the drawing-room, and
there await her aunts coming up from dinner.&nbsp; She generally
had a book of her own, or else she read bits of those lying on
the tables, till Lady Barbara caught her, and in spite of her
protest that at home she might always read any book on the table
ordered her never to touch any without express permission.</p>
<p>Sometimes the aunts worked; sometimes Lady Barbara played and
sang.&nbsp; They wanted Kate to sit up as they did with fancy
work, and she had a bunch of flowers in Berlin wool which she was
supposed to be grounding; but she much disliked it, and seldom
set three stitches when her aunts&rsquo; eyes were not upon
her.&nbsp; Lady Jane was a great worker, and tried to teach her
some pretty stitches; but though she began by liking to sit by
the soft gentle aunt, she was so clumsy a pupil, that Lady
Barbara declared that her sister must not be worried, and put a
stop to the lessons.&nbsp; So Kate sometimes read, or dawdled
over her grounding; or when Aunt Barbara was singing, she would
nestle up to her other aunt, and go off into some dreamy fancy of
growing up, getting home to the Wardours, or having them to live
with her at her own home; or even of a great revolution, in
which, after the pattern of the French nobility, she should have
to maintain Aunt Jane by the labour of her hands!&nbsp; What was
to become of Aunt Barbara was uncertain; perhaps she was to be in
prison, and Kate to bring food to her in a little basket every
day; or else she was to run away: but Aunt Jane was to live in a
nice little lodging, with no one to wait on her but her dear
little niece, who was to paint beautiful screens for her
livelihood, and make her coffee with her own hands.&nbsp; Poor
Lady Jane!</p>
<p>Bed-time came at last&mdash;horrible bed-time, with all its
terrors!&nbsp; At first Kate persuaded Josephine and her light to
stay till sleep came to put an end to them; but Lady Barbara came
up one evening, declared that a girl of eleven years old must not
be permitted in such childish nonsense, and ordered Josephine to
go down at once, and always to put out the candle as soon as Lady
Caergwent was in bed.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara would hardly have done so if she had known how
much suffering she caused; but she had always been too sensible
to know what the misery of fancies could be, nor how the silly
little brain imagined everything possible and impossible;
sometimes that thieves were breaking in&mdash;sometimes that the
house was on fire&mdash;sometimes that she should be smothered
with pillows, like the princes in the Tower, for the sake of her
title&mdash;sometimes that the Gunpowder Plot would be acted
under the house!</p>
<p>Most often of all it was a thought that was not foolish and
unreal like the rest.&nbsp; It was the thought that the Last
Judgment might be about to begin.&nbsp; But Kate did not use that
thought as it was meant to be used when we are bidden to
&ldquo;watch.&rdquo;&nbsp; If she had done so, she would have
striven every morning to &ldquo;live this day as if the
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she never thought of it in the morning,
nor made it a guide to her actions; or else she would have
dreaded it less.&nbsp; And at night it did not make her
particular about obedience.&nbsp; It only made her want to keep
Josephine; as if Josephine and a candle could protect her from
that Day and Hour!&nbsp; And if the moment had come, would she
not have been safer trying to endure hardness for the sake of
obedience&mdash;with the holy verses Mr. Wardour had taught her
on her lips, alone with her God and her good angel&mdash;than
trying to forget all in idle chatter with her maid, and contrary
to known commands, detaining her by foolish excuses?</p>
<p>It is true that Kate did not feel as if obedience to Lady
Barbara was the same duty as obedience to
&ldquo;Papa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it was not in the nature of
things that she should; but no one can habitually practise petty
disobedience to one &ldquo;placed in authority over&rdquo; her,
without hurting the whole disposition.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thursday</span> morning!&nbsp;
Bother&mdash;calisthenic day!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go to sleep again,
to put it off as long as I can.&nbsp; If I was only a little
countess in her own feudal keep, I would get up in the dawn, and
gather flowers in the May dew&mdash;primroses and
eglantine!&mdash;Charlie says it is affected to call sweet-briar
eglantine.&mdash;Sylvia!&nbsp; Sylvia! that thorn has got hold of
me; and there&rsquo;s Aunt Barbara coming down the lane in the
baker&rsquo;s jiggeting cart.&mdash;Oh dear! was it only
dreaming?&nbsp; I thought I was gathering dog-roses with Charlie
and Sylvia in the lane; and now it is only Thursday, and horrid
calisthenic day!&nbsp; I suppose I must wake up.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Awake, my soul, and with the sun<br />
Thy daily stage of duty run.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a very tiresome sort of stage!&nbsp;
We used to say, &lsquo;As happy as a queen:&rsquo; I am sure if
the Queen is as much less happy than a countess as I am than a
common little girl, she must be miserable indeed!&nbsp; It is
like a rule-of-three sum.&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;if a common
little girl has one hundred happinesses a day, and a countess
only&mdash;only five&mdash;how many has the Queen?&nbsp;
No&mdash;but how much higher is a queen than a countess?&nbsp; If
I were Queen, I would put an end to aunts and to calisthenic
exercises; and I would send for all my orphan nobility, and let
them choose their own governesses and playfellows, and always
live with country clergymen!&nbsp; I am sure nobody ought to be
oppressed as Aunt Barbara oppresses me: it is just like James V.
of Scotland when the Douglases got hold of him!&nbsp; I wonder
what is the use of being a countess, if one never is to do
anything to please oneself, and one is to live with a cross old
aunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most likely everyone is of Lady Caergwent&rsquo;s morning
opinion&mdash;that Lady Barbara Umfraville was cross, and that it
was a hard lot to live in subjection to her.&nbsp; But there are
two sides to a question; and there were other hardships in that
house besides those of the Countess of Caergwent.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, two little sisters had been growing up
together, so fond of each other that they were like one; and
though the youngest, Barbara, was always brighter, stronger,
braver, and cleverer, than gentle Jane, she never enjoyed what
her sister could not do; and neither of them ever wanted any
amusement beyond quiet play with their dolls and puzzles,
contrivances in pretty fancy works, and walks with their
governess in trim gravel paths.&nbsp; They had two elder brothers
and one younger; but they had never played out of doors with
them, and had not run about or romped since they were almost
babies; they would not have known how; and Jane was always sickly
and feeble, and would have been very unhappy with loud or active
ways.</p>
<p>As time passed on, Jane became more weakly and delicate while
Barbara grew up very handsome, and full of life and spirit, but
fonder of her sister than ever, and always coming home from her
parties and gaieties, as if telling Jane about them was the best
part of all.</p>
<p>At last, Lady Barbara was engaged to be married to a brother
officer of her second brother, James; but just then poor Jane
fell so ill, that the doctors said she could not live through the
year.&nbsp; Barbara loved her sister far too well to think of
marrying at such a time, and said she must attend to no one
else.&nbsp; All that winter and spring she was nursing her sister
day and night, watching over her, and quite keeping up the little
spark of life, the doctors said, by her tender care.&nbsp; And
though Lady Jane lived on day after day, she never grew so much
better as to be fit to hear of the engagement and that if she
recovered her sister would be separated from her; and so weeks
went on, and still nothing could be done about the marriage.</p>
<p>As it turned out, this was the best thing that could have
happened to Lady Barbara; for in the course of this time, it came
to her father&rsquo;s knowledge that her brother and her lover
had both behaved disgracefully, and that, if she had married, she
must have led a very unhappy life.&nbsp; He caused the engagement
to be broken off.&nbsp; She knew it was right, and made no
complaint to anybody; but she always believed that it was her
brother James who had been the tempter, who had led his friend
astray; and from that time, though she was more devoted than ever
to her sick sister, she was soft and bright to nobody else.&nbsp;
She did not complain, but she thought that things had been very
hard with her; and when people repine their troubles do not make
them kinder, but the brave grow stern and the soft grow
fretful.</p>
<p>All this had been over for nearly thirty years, and the
brother and the friend had both been long dead.&nbsp; Lady
Barbara was very anxious to do all that she thought right; and
she was so wise and sensible, and so careful of her sister Jane,
that all the family respected her and looked up to her.&nbsp; She
thought she had quite forgiven all that had passed: she did not
know why it was so hard to her to take any notice of her brother
James&rsquo;s only son.&nbsp; Perhaps, if she had, she would have
forced herself to try to be more warm and kind to him, and not
have inflamed Lord Caergwent&rsquo;s displeasure when he married
imprudently.&nbsp; Her sister Jane had never known all that had
passed: she had been too ill to hear of it at the time; and it
was not Lady Barbara&rsquo;s way to talk to other people of her
own troubles.&nbsp; But Jane was always led by her sister, and
never thought of people, or judged events, otherwise than as
Barbara told her; so that, kind and gentle as she was by nature,
she was like a double of her sister, instead of by her mildness
telling on the family counsels.&nbsp; The other brother, Giles,
had been aware of all, and saw how it was; but he was so much
younger than the rest, that he was looked on by them like a boy
long after he was grown up, and had not felt entitled to break
through his sister Barbara&rsquo;s reserve, so as to venture on
opening out the sorrows so long past, and pleading for his
brother James&rsquo;s family, though he had done all he could for
them himself.&nbsp; He had indeed been almost constantly on
foreign service, and had seen very little of his sisters.</p>
<p>Since their father&rsquo;s death, the two sisters had lived
their quiet life together.&nbsp; They were just rich enough to
live in the way they thought the duty of persons in their rank,
keeping their carriage for Lady Jane&rsquo;s daily drive, and
spending two months every year by the sea, and one at Caergwent
Castle with their eldest brother.&nbsp; They always had a spare
room for any old friend who wanted to come up to town; and they
did many acts of kindness, and gave a great deal to be spent on
the poor of their parish.&nbsp; They did the same quiet things
every day: one liked what the other liked; and Lady Barbara
thought, morning, noon, and night, what would be good for her
sister&rsquo;s health; while Lady Jane rested on Barbara&rsquo;s
care, and was always pleased with whatever came in her way.</p>
<p>And so the two sisters had gone on year after year, and were
very happy in their own way, till the great grief came of losing
their eldest brother; and not long after him, his son, the nephew
who had been their great pride and delight, and for whom they had
so many plans and hopes.</p>
<p>And with his death, there came what they felt to be the duty
and necessity of trying to fit the poor little heiress for her
station.&nbsp; They were not fond of any children; and it upset
all their ways very much to have to make room for a little girl,
her maid, and her governess; but still, if she had been such a
little girl as they had been, and always like the well-behaved
children whom they saw in drawing-rooms, they would have known
what kind of creature had come into their hands.</p>
<p>But was it not very hard on them that their niece should turn
out a little wild harum-scarum creature, such as they had never
dreamt of&mdash;really unable to move without noises that
startled Lady Jane&rsquo;s nerves, and threw Lady Barbara into
despair at the harm they would do&mdash;a child whose untutored
movements were a constant eye-sore and distress to them; and
though she could sometimes be bright and fairy-like if
unconstrained, always grew abrupt and uncouth when under
restraint&mdash;a child very far from silly, but apt to say the
silliest things&mdash;learning quickly all that was mere
head-work, but hopelessly or obstinately dull at what was to be
done by the fingers&mdash;a child whose ways could not be called
vulgar, but would have been completely tom-boyish, except for a
certain timidity that deprived them of the one merit of courage,
and a certain frightened consciousness that was in truth modesty,
though it did not look like it?&nbsp; To have such a being to
endure, and more than that, to break into the habits of civilized
life, and the dignity of a lady of rank, was no small burden for
them; but they thought it right, and made up their minds to bear
it.</p>
<p>Of course it would have been better if they had taken home the
little orphan when she was destitute and an additional weight to
Mr. Wardour; and had she been actually in poverty or distress,
with no one to take care of her, Lady Barbara would have thought
it a duty to provide for her: but knowing her to be in good
hands, it had not then seemed needful to inflict the child on her
sister, or to conquer her own distaste to all connected with her
unhappy brother James.&nbsp; No one had ever thought of the
little Katharine Aileve Umfraville becoming the head of the
family; for then young Lord Umfraville was in his full health and
strength.</p>
<p>And why <i>did</i> Lady Barbara only now feel the charge of
the child a duty?&nbsp; Perhaps it was because, without knowing
it, she had been brought up to make an idol of the state and
consequence of the earldom, since she thought breeding up the
girl for a countess incumbent on her, when she had not felt
tender compassion for the brother&rsquo;s orphan
grandchild.&nbsp; So somewhat of the pomps of this world may have
come in to blind her eyes; but whatever she did was because she
thought it right to do, and when Kate thought of her as cross, it
was a great mistake.&nbsp; Lady Barbara had great control of
temper, and did everything by rule, keeping herself as strictly
as she did everyone else except Lady Jane; and though she could
not like such a troublesome little incomprehensible wild cat as
Katharine, she was always trying to do her strict justice, and
give her whatever in her view was good or useful.</p>
<p>But Kate esteemed it a great holiday, when, as sometimes
happened, Aunt Barbara went out to spend the evening with some
friends; and she, under promise of being very good, used to be
Aunt Jane&rsquo;s companion.</p>
<p>Those were the times when her tongue took a holiday, and it
must be confessed, rather to the astonishment and confusion of
Lady Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jane, do tell me about yourself when you were a
little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear, that does not seem so very long ago.&nbsp;
Time passes very quickly.&nbsp; To think of such a great girl as
you being poor James&rsquo;s grandchild!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was my grandpapa much older than you, Aunt
Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three years older, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do tell me how you played with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did, my dear; I played with your Aunt
Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me how stupid!&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t do things
without boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear; boys always spoil girls&rsquo; play, they
are so rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, no, Aunt Jane; there&rsquo;s no fun unless one
is rough&mdash;I mean, not rough exactly; but it&rsquo;s no use
playing unless one makes a jolly good noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Lady Jane, greatly shocked,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you talk so, nor to use such
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Aunt Jane, we say &lsquo;Jolly&rsquo; twenty
times a day at St. James&rsquo;s, and nobody minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, you see you played with boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our boys are not rough, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; persisted
Kate, who liked hearing herself talk much better than anyone
else.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary says Charlie is a great deal less riotous
than I am, especially since he went to school; and Armyn is too
big to be riotous.&nbsp; Oh dear, I wish Mr. Brown would send
Armyn to London; he said he would be sure to come and see me, and
he is the jolliest, most delightful fellow in the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Lady Jane in her soft,
distressed voice, &ldquo;indeed that is not the way young ladies
talk of&mdash;of&mdash;boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armyn is not a boy, Aunt Jane; he&rsquo;s a man.&nbsp;
He is a clerk, you know, and will get a salary in another
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clerk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in Mr. Brown&rsquo;s office, you know.&nbsp; Aunt
Jane, did you ever go out to tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; sometimes we drank tea with our little
friends in the dolls&rsquo; tea-cups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can&rsquo;t think what fun we have when Mrs.
Brown asks us to tea.&nbsp; She has got the nicest garden in the
world, and a greenhouse, and a great squirt-syringe, I mean, to
water it; and we always used to get it, till once, without
meaning it, I squirted right through the drawing-room window, and
made such a puddle; and Mrs. Brown thought it was Charlie, only I
ran in and told of myself, and Mrs. Brown said it was very
generous, and gave me a Venetian weight with a little hermit in a
snow-storm; only it is worn out now, and won&rsquo;t snow, so I
gave it to little Lily when we had the whooping-cough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Lady Jane was utterly ignorant what the gabble
was about, except that Katharine had been in very odd company,
and done very strange things with those boys, and she gave a
melancholy little sound in the pause; but Kate, taking breath,
ran on again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because Mrs. Brown is not used to educating
children, you know, that she fancies one wants a reward for
telling the truth; I told her so, but Mary thought it would vex
her, and stopped my mouth.&nbsp; Well, then we young
ones&mdash;that is, Charlie, and Sylvia, and Armyn, and
I&mdash;drank tea out on the lawn.&nbsp; Mary had to sit up and
be company; but we had such fun!&nbsp; There was a great old
laurel tree, and Armyn put Sylvia and me up into the fork; and
that was our nest, and we were birds, and he fed us with
strawberries; and we pretended to be learning to fly, and stood
up flapping our frocks and squeaking, and Charlie came under and
danced the branches about.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t like that; and
Armyn said it was a shame, and hunted him away, racing all round
the garden; and we scrambled down by ourselves, and came down on
the slope.&nbsp; It is a long green slope, right down to the
river, all smooth and turfy, you know; and I was standing at the
top, when Charlie comes slyly, and saying he would help the
little bird to fly, gave me one push, and down I went, roll,
roll, tumble, tumble, till Sylvia <i>really</i> thought she heard
my neck crack!&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the river, my dear!&rdquo; said Lady Jane,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there was a good flat place before we came to the
river, and I stopped long before that!&nbsp; So then, as we had
been the birds of the air, we thought we would be the fishes of
the sea; and it was nice and shallow, with dear little caddises
and river cray-fish, and great British pearl-shells at the
bottom.&nbsp; So we took off our shoes and stockings, and Charlie
and Armyn turned up their trousers, and we had such a nice
paddling.&nbsp; I really thought I should have got a British
pearl then; and you know there were some in the breast-plate of
Venus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the river!&nbsp; Did your cousin allow
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; we had on our old blue checks; and Mary never
minds anything when Armyn is there to take care of us.&nbsp; When
they heard in the drawing-room what we had been doing, they made
Mary sing &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rsquo; because of &lsquo;We twa
hae paidlit in the burn frae morning sun till dine;&rsquo; and
whenever in future times I meet Armyn, I mean to say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We twa hae paidlit in the burn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frae morning sun till dine;<br />
We&rsquo;ve wandered many a weary foot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin auld lang syne.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps I shall be able to sing it, and that will be still
prettier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kate sat still, thinking of the prettiness of the scene of
the stranger, alone in the midst of numbers, in the splendid
drawing-rooms, hearing the sweet voice of the lovely young
countess at the piano, singing this touching memorial of the
simple days of childhood.</p>
<p>Lady Jane meanwhile worked her embroidery, and thought what
wonderful disadvantages the poor child had had, and that Barbara
really must not be too severe on her, after she had lived with
such odd people, and that it was very fortunate that she had been
taken away from them before she had grown any older, or more used
to them.</p>
<p>Soon after, Kate gave a specimen of her manners with
boys.&nbsp; When she went into the dining-room at luncheon time
one wet afternoon, she heard steps on the stairs behind her
aunt&rsquo;s, and there appeared a very pleasant-looking
gentleman, followed by a boy of about her own age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is our niece,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Katharine, come and speak to Lord de la Poer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate liked his looks, and the way in which he held out his
hand to her; but she knew she should be scolded for her awkward
greeting: so she put out her hand as if she had no use of her arm
above the elbow, hung down her head, and said
&ldquo;&mdash;do;&rdquo; at least no more was audible.</p>
<p>But there was something comfortable and encouraging in the
grasp of the strong large hand over the foolish little fingers;
and he quite gave them to his son, whose shake was a real treat;
the contact with anything young was like meeting a
follow-countryman in a foreign land, though neither as yet
spoke.</p>
<p>She found out that the boy&rsquo;s name was Ernest, and that
his father was taking him to school, but had come to arrange some
business matters for her aunts upon the way.&nbsp; She listened
with interest to Lord de la Poer&rsquo;s voice, for she liked it,
and was sure he was a greater friend there than any she had
before seen.&nbsp; He was talking about Giles&mdash;that was her
uncle, the Colonel in India; and she first gathered from what was
passing that her uncle&rsquo;s eldest and only surviving son, an
officer in his own regiment, had never recovered a wound he had
received at the relief of Lucknow, and that if he did not get
better at Simlah, where his mother had just taken him, his father
thought of retiring and bringing him home, though all agreed that
it would be a very unfortunate thing that the Colonel should be
obliged to resign his command before getting promoted; but they
fully thought he would do so, for this was the last of his
children; another son had been killed in the Mutiny, and two or
three little girls had been born and died in India.</p>
<p>Kate had never known this.&nbsp; Her aunts never told her
anything, nor talked over family affairs before her; and she was
opening her ears most eagerly, and turning her quick bright eyes
from one speaker to the other with such earnest attention, that
the guest turned kindly to her, and said, &ldquo;Do you remember
your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no!&nbsp; I was a little baby when he went
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate never used <i>dear</i> as an adjective except at the
beginning of a letter, but always, and very unnecessarily, as an
interjection; and this time it was so emphatic as to bring Lady
Barbara&rsquo;s eyes on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see either Giles or poor Frank before they went
out to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the <i>dear</i> was from the confusion that made her
always do the very thing she ought not to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; my niece has been too much separated from her own
relations,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, putting this as an excuse
for the &ldquo;Oh dears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Mr. Wardour is quite well,&rdquo; said Lord de
la Poer, turning again to Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, quite, thank you;&rdquo; and then with
brightening eyes, she ventured on &ldquo;Do you know
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him two or three times,&rdquo; he answered with
increased kindness of manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you remember me
to him when you write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Kate promptly; &ldquo;but he
says all those sort of things are nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horror of the two aunts was only kept in check by the good
manners that hindered a public scolding; but Lord de la Poer only
laughed heartily, and said, &ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; What sort of
things, may I ask, Lady Caergwent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;love, and regards, and remembrances.&nbsp;
Mary used to get letters from her school-fellows, all filled with
dearest loves, and we always laughed at her; and Armyn used to
say them by heart beforehand,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to observe,&rdquo; was the answer, in the grave
tone which, however, Kate understood as fun, &ldquo;that I did
not presume to send my love to Mr. Wardour.&nbsp; May not that
make the case different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kate meditatively; &ldquo;only I
don&rsquo;t know that your remembrance would be of more use than
your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are we never to send any messages unless they are
of use?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a puzzling question, and Kate did
not immediately reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None for pleasure&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but I don&rsquo;t see what would be the
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, do you consider it pleasurable to be universally
forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever could forget Pa&mdash;my Uncle
Wardour,&rdquo; cried Kate, with eager vehemence flashing in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer, in a voice
as if he were much pleased with her; &ldquo;he is not a man to be
forgotten.&nbsp; It is a privilege to have been brought up by
him.&nbsp; But come, Lady Caergwent, since you are so critical,
will you be pleased to devise some message for me, that may
combine use, pleasure, and my deep respect for him?&rdquo; and as
she sat beside him at the table, he laid his hand on hers, so
that she felt that he really meant what he said.</p>
<p>She sat fixed in deep thought; and her aunts, who had been
miserable all through the conversation, began to speak of other
things; but in the midst the shrill little voice broke in,
&ldquo;I know what!&rdquo; and good-natured Lord de la Poer
turned at once, smiling, and saying, &ldquo;Well,
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would help in the new aisle!&nbsp; You know the
church is not big enough; there are so many people come into the
district, with the new ironworks, you know; and we have not got
half room enough, and can&rsquo;t make more, though we have three
services; and we want to build a new aisle, and it will cost
&pound;250, but we have only got &pound;139 15<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; And if you would but be so kind as to give one
sovereign for it&mdash;that would be better than remembrances and
respects, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think it would,&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer;
and though Lady Barbara eagerly exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! do not
think of it; the child does not know what she is talking
of.&nbsp; Pray excuse her&mdash;&rdquo; he took out his purse,
and from it came a crackling smooth five-pound note, which he put
into the hand, saying, &ldquo;There, my dear, cut that in two,
and send the two halves on different days to Mr. Wardour, with my
best wishes for his success in his good works.&nbsp; Will that
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate turned quite red, and only perpetrated a choked sound of
her favourite &mdash;q.&nbsp; For the whole world she could not
have said more: but though she knew perfectly well that anger and
wrath were hanging over her, she felt happier than for many a
long week.</p>
<p>Presently the aunts rose, and Lady Barbara said to her in the
low ceremonious voice that was a sure sign of warning and
displeasure, &ldquo;You had better come up stairs with us,
Katharine, and amuse Lord Ernest in the back drawing-room while
his father is engaged with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart leapt up at the sound
&ldquo;amuse.&rdquo;&nbsp; She popped her precious note into her
pocket, bounded up-stairs, and opened the back drawing-room door
for her playfellow, as he brought up the rear of the
procession.</p>
<p>Lord de la Poer and Lady Barbara spread the table with papers;
Lady Jane sat by; the children were behind the heavy red curtains
that parted off the second room.&nbsp; There was a great silence
at first, then began a little tittering, then a little
chattering, then presently a stifled explosion.&nbsp; Lady
Barbara began to betray some restlessness; she really must see
what that child was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer; &ldquo;leave them
in peace.&nbsp; That poor girl will never thrive unless you let
her use her voice and limbs.&nbsp; I shall make her come over and
enjoy herself with my flock when we come up <i>en
masse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explosions were less carefully stifled, and there were
some sounds of rushing about, some small shrieks, and then the
door shut, and there was a silence again.</p>
<p>By this it may be perceived that Kate and Ernest had become
tolerably intimate friends.&nbsp; They had informed each other of
what games were their favourites; Kate had told him the Wardour
names and ages; and required from him in return those of his
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; She had been greatly delighted by
learning that Adelaide was no end of a hand at climbing trees;
and that whenever she should come and stay at their house, Ernest
would teach her to ride.&nbsp; And then they began to consider
what play was possible under the present
circumstances&mdash;beginning they hardly knew how, by dodging
one another round and round the table, making snatches at one
another, gradually assuming the characters of hunter and Red
Indian.&nbsp; Only when the hunter had snatched up Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s tortoise-shell paper-cutter to stab with,
complaining direfully that it was a stupid place, with nothing
for a gun, and the Red Indian&rsquo;s crinoline had knocked down
two chairs, she recollected the consequences in time to strangle
her own war-whoop, and suggested that they should be safer on the
stairs; to which Ernest readily responded, adding that there was
a great gallery at home all full of pillars and statues, the
jolliest place in the world for making a row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear! how I hope I shall go there!&rdquo;
cried Kate, swinging between the rails of the
landing-place.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do want of all things to see a
statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A statue! why, don&rsquo;t you see lots every
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean great equestrian things
like the Trafalgar Square ones, or the Duke&mdash;or anything big
and horrid, like Achilles in the Park, holding up a shield like a
green umbrella.&nbsp; I want to see the work of the great
sculptor Julio Romano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t a sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was; didn&rsquo;t he sculp&mdash;no, what is
the word&mdash;Hermione.&nbsp; No; I mean they pretended he had
done her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hermione!&nbsp; What, have you seen the
&lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa&mdash;Uncle Wardour, that is&mdash;read it to us
last Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve seen it.&nbsp; Alfred and I went to it
last spring with our tutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then do, pray, let us play at it.&nbsp; Look,
there&rsquo;s a little stand up there, where I have always so
wanted to get up and be Hermione, and descend to the sound of
slow music.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a musical-box in the back
drawing-room that will make the music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; but I must be the lion and bear killing the
courtier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes&mdash;very well, and I&rsquo;ll be courtier; only
I must get a sofa-cushion to be Perdita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Bohemia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the hall must be Bohemia, and the stair-carpet the
sea, because then the aunts won&rsquo;t hear the lion and bear
roaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these precautions, the characteristic roaring and
growling of lion and bear, and the shrieks of the courtier,
though not absolutely unheard in the drawing-room, produced no
immediate results.&nbsp; But in the very midst of Lady
Jane&rsquo;s signing her name to some paper, she gave a violent
start, and dropped the pen, for they were no stage
shrieks&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! ah!&nbsp; It is coming down!&nbsp; Help
me down!&nbsp; Ernest, Ernest! help me down!&nbsp;
Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;and then a great fall.</p>
<p>The little mahogany bracket on the wall had been mounted by
the help of a chair, but it was only fixed into the plaster,
being intended to hold a small lamp, and not for young ladies to
stand on; so no sooner was the chair removed by which Kate had
mounted, than she felt not only giddy in her elevation, but found
her pedestal loosening!&nbsp; There was no room to jump; and
Ernest, perhaps enjoying what he regarded as a girl&rsquo;s
foolish fright, was a good way off, endeavouring to wind up the
musical-box, when the bracket gave way, and Hermione descended
precipitately with anything but the sound of soft music; and as
the inhabitants of the drawing-room rushed out to the rescue, her
legs were seen kicking in the air upon the landing-place; Ernest
looking on, not knowing whether to laugh or be dismayed.</p>
<p>Lord de la Poer picked her up, and sat down on the stairs with
her between his knees to look her over and see whether she were
hurt, or what was the matter, while she stood half sobbing with
the fright and shock.&nbsp; He asked his son rather severely what
he had been doing to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did nothing,&rdquo; gasped Kate; &ldquo;I was only
Hermione.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all, Papa,&rdquo; repeated Ernest;
&ldquo;it is all the fault of the plaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a sort of explanation was performed between the two
children, at which Lord de la Poer could hardly keep his gravity,
though he was somewhat vexed at the turn affairs had taken.&nbsp;
He was not entirely devoid of awe of the Lady Barbara, and would
have liked his children to be on their best behaviour before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am glad there is no
worse harm done.&nbsp; You had better defer your statueship till
we can find you a sounder pedestal, Lady Caergwent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! call me Kate,&rdquo; whispered she in his ear,
turning redder than the fright had made her.</p>
<p>He smiled, and patted her hand; then added, &ldquo;We must go
and beg pardon, I suppose; I should not wonder if the catastrophe
had damaged Aunt Jane the most; and if so, I don&rsquo;t know
what will be done to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right; Lady Barbara had only satisfied herself that no
bones had been broken, and then turned back to reassure her
sister; but Lady Jane could not be frightened without suffering
for it, and was lying back on the sofa, almost faint with
palpitation, when Lord de la Poer, with Kate&rsquo;s hand in his,
came to the door, looking much more consciously guilty than his
son, who on the whole was more diverted than penitent at the
commotion they had made.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara looked very grand and very dignified, but Lord de
la Poer was so grieved for Lady Jane&rsquo;s indisposition, that
she was somewhat softened; and then he began asking pardon,
blending himself with the children so comically, that in all her
fright and anxiety, Kate wondered how her aunt could help
laughing.</p>
<p>It never was Lady Barbara&rsquo;s way to reprove before a
guest; but this good gentleman was determined that she should not
reserve her displeasure for his departure, and he would not go
away till he had absolutely made her promise that his little
friend, as he called Kate, should hear nothing more about
anything that had that day taken place.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara kept her promise.&nbsp; She uttered no reproof
either on her niece&rsquo;s awkward greeting, her abrupt
conversation and its tendency to pertness, nor on the loudness of
the unlucky game and the impropriety of climbing; nor even on
what had greatly annoyed her, the asking for the subscription to
the church.&nbsp; There was neither blame nor punishment; but she
could not help a certain cold restraint of manner, by which Kate
knew that she was greatly displeased, and regarded her as the
most hopeless little saucy romp that ever maiden aunt was
afflicted with.</p>
<p>And certainly it was hard on her.&nbsp; She had a great regard
for Lord de la Poer, and thought his a particularly well trained
family; and she was especially desirous that her little niece
should appear to advantage before him.&nbsp; Nothing, she was
sure, but Katharine&rsquo;s innate naughtiness could have made
that well-behaved little Ernest break out into rudeness; and
though his father had shown such good nature, he must have been
very much shocked.&nbsp; What was to be done to tame this
terrible little savage, was poor Lady Barbara&rsquo;s haunting
thought, morning, noon, and night!</p>
<p>And what was it that Kate did want?&nbsp; I believe nothing
could have made her perfectly happy, or suited to her aunt; but
that she would have been infinitely happier and better off had
she had the spirit of obedience, of humility, or of
unselfishness.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> one hour of play with Ernest de
la Poer had the effect of making Kate long more and more for a
return of &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; and of intercourse with beings of
her own age and of high spirits.</p>
<p>She wove to herself dreams of possible delights with Sylvia
and Charlie, if the summer visit could be paid to them; and at
other times she imagined her Uncle Giles&rsquo;s two daughters
still alive, and sent home for education, arranging in her busy
brain wonderful scenes, in which she, with their assistance,
should be happy in spite of Aunt Barbara.</p>
<p>These fancies, however, would be checked by the recollection,
that it was shocking to lower two happy spirits in Heaven into
playful little girls upon earth; and she took refuge in the
thought of the coming chance of playfellows, when Lord de la Poer
was to bring his family to London.&nbsp; She had learnt the names
and ages of all the ten; and even had her own theories as to what
her contemporaries were to be like&mdash;Mary and Fanny,
Ernest&rsquo;s elders, and Adelaide and Grace, who came next
below him; she had a vision for each of them, and felt as if she
already knew them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the want of the amount of air and running about to
which she had been used, did really tell upon her; she had giddy
feelings in the morning, tired limbs, and a weary listless air,
and fretted over her lessons at times.&nbsp; So they showed her
to the doctor, who came to see Lady Jane every alternate day; and
when he said she wanted more exercise, her morning walk was made
an hour longer, and a shuttlecock and battledores were bought,
with which it was decreed that Mrs. Lacy should play with her for
exactly half an hour every afternoon, or an hour when it was too
wet to go out.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that this was a harder task to both than
the music lessons.&nbsp; Whether it were from the difference of
height, or from Kate&rsquo;s innate unhandiness, they never could
keep that unhappy shuttlecock up more than three times; and Mrs.
Lacy looked as grave and melancholy all the time as if she played
it for a punishment, making little efforts to be cheerful that
were sad to see.&nbsp; Kate hated it, and was always cross; and
willingly would they have given it up by mutual consent, but the
instant the tap of the cork against the parchment ceased, if it
were not half-past five, down sailed Lady Barbara to inquire
after her prescription.</p>
<p>She had been a famous battledore-player in the galleries of
Caergwent Castle; and once when she took up the battledore to
give a lesson, it seemed as if, between her and Mrs. Lacy, the
shuttlecock would not come down&mdash;they kept up five hundred
and eighty-one, and then only stopped because it was necessary
for her to go to dinner.</p>
<p>She could not conceive anyone being unable to play at
battledore, and thought Kate&rsquo;s failures and dislike pure
perverseness.&nbsp; Once Kate by accident knocked her shuttlecock
through the window, and hoped she had got rid of it; but she was
treated as if she had done it out of naughtiness, and a new
instrument of torture, as she called it, was bought for her.</p>
<p>It was no wonder she did not see the real care for her
welfare, and thought this intensely cruel and unkind; but it was
a great pity that she visited her vexation on poor Mrs. Lacy, to
whom the game was even a greater penance than to herself,
especially on a warm day, with a bad headache.</p>
<p>Even in her best days at home, Kate had resisted learning to
take thought for others.&nbsp; She had not been considerate of
Mary&rsquo;s toil, nor of Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s peace, except when
Armyn or Sylvia reminded her; and now that she had neither of
them to put it into her mind, she never once thought of her
governess as one who ought to be spared and pitied.&nbsp; Yet if
she had been sorry for Mrs. Lacy, and tried to spare her trouble
and annoyance, how much irritability and peevishness, and sense
of constant naughtiness, would have been prevented!&nbsp; And it
was that feeling of being always naughty that was what had become
the real dreariness of Kate&rsquo;s present home, and was far
worse than the music, the battledore, or even the absence of
fun.</p>
<p>At last came a message that Lady Caergwent was to be dressed
for going out to make a call with Lady Barbara as soon as
luncheon was over.</p>
<p>It could be on no one but the De la Poers; and Kate was so
delighted, that she executed all manner of little happy hops,
skips, and fidgets, all the time of her toilette, and caused many
an expostulation of &ldquo;Mais, Miladi!&rdquo; from Josephine,
before the pretty delicate blue and white muslin, worked white
jacket, and white ribboned and feathered hat, were
adjusted.&nbsp; Lady Barbara kept her little countess very
prettily and quietly dressed; but it was at the cost of infinite
worry of herself, Kate, and Josephine, for there never was a
child whom it was so hard to keep in decent trim.&nbsp;
Armyn&rsquo;s old saying, that she ought to be always kept
dressed in sacking, as the only thing she could not spoil, was a
true one; for the sharp hasty movements, and entire disregard of
where she stepped, were so ruinous, that it was on the records of
the Bruton Street household, that she had gone far to demolish
eight frocks in ten days.</p>
<p>However, on this occasion she did get safe down to the
carriage&mdash;clothes, gloves, and all, without detriment or
scolding; and jumped in first.&nbsp; She was a long way yet from
knowing that, though her aunts gave the first place to her rank,
it would have been proper in her to yield it to their years, and
make way for them.</p>
<p>She was too childish to have learnt this as a matter of good
breeding, but she might have learnt it of a certain parable,
which she could say from beginning to end, that she should
&ldquo;sit not down in the highest room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her aunt sat down beside her, and spent the first ten minutes
of the drive in enjoining on her proper behaviour at Lady de la
Poer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The children there were exceedingly well
brought up, she said, and she was very desirous they should be
her niece&rsquo;s friends; but she was certain that Lady de la
Poer would allow no one to associate with them who did not behave
properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord de la Poer was very kind to me just as I
was,&rdquo; said Kate, in her spirit of contradiction, which was
always reckless of consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen are no judges of what is becoming to a little
girl,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless you
make a very different impression upon Lady de la Poer, she will
never permit you to be the friend of her daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how I am to make an impression,&rdquo;
meditated Kate, as they drove on; &ldquo;I suppose it would make
an impression if I stood up and repeated, &lsquo;Ruin seize thee,
ruthless king!&rsquo; or something of that sort, as soon as I got
in.&nbsp; But one couldn&rsquo;t do that; and I am afraid nothing
will happen.&nbsp; If the horses would only upset us at the door,
and Aunt Barbara be nicely insensible, and the young countess
show the utmost presence of mind!&nbsp; But nothing nice and like
a book ever does happen.&nbsp; And after all, I believe that it
is all nonsense about making impressions.&nbsp; Thinking of them
is all affectation; and one ought to be as simple and unconscious
as one can.&rdquo;&nbsp; A conclusion which did honour to the
countess&rsquo;s sense.&nbsp; In fact, she had plenty of sense,
if only she had ever used it for herself, instead of for the
little ladies she drew on her quires of paper.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara had started early, as she really wished to find
her friends at home; and accordingly, when the stairs were
mounted, and the aunt and niece were ushered into a pretty
bright-looking drawing-room, there they found all that were not
at school enjoying their after-dinner hour of liberty with their
father and mother.</p>
<p>Lord de la Poer himself had the youngest in his arms, and
looked very much as if he had only just scrambled up from the
floor; his wife was really sitting on the ground, helping two
little ones to put up a puzzle of wild beasts; and there was a
little herd of girls at the farther corner, all very busy over
something, towards which Kate&rsquo;s longing eyes at once
turned&mdash;even in the midst of Lord de la Poer&rsquo;s very
kind greeting, and his wife&rsquo;s no less friendly welcome.</p>
<p>It was true that, as Lady Barbara had said, they were all
exceedingly well-bred children.&nbsp; Even the little fellow in
his father&rsquo;s arms, though but eighteen months old, made no
objection to hold out his fat hand graciously, and showed no
shyness when Lady Barbara kissed him! and the others all waited
quietly over their several occupations, neither shrinking
foolishly from notice, nor putting themselves forward to claim
it.&nbsp; Only the four sisters came up, and took their own
special visitor into the midst of them as their own property; the
elder of them, however, at a sign from her mamma, taking the baby
in her arms, and carrying him off, followed by the other two
small ones&mdash;only pausing at the door for him to kiss his
little hand, and wave it in the prettiest fashion of baby
stateliness.</p>
<p>The other sisters drew Kate back with them into the room,
where they had been busy.&nbsp; Generally, however much she and
Sylvia might wish it, they had found acquaintance with other
children absolutely impossible in the presence of grown-up
people, whose eyes and voices seemed to strike all parties
dumb.&nbsp; But these children seemed in no wise constrained: one
of them said at once, &ldquo;We are so glad you are come.&nbsp;
Mamma said she thought you would before we went out, one of those
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it horrid going out in London?&rdquo; asked
Kate, at once set at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so nice as it is at home,&rdquo; said one of
the girls; laughing; &ldquo;except when it is our turn to go out
with Mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She takes us all out in turn,&rdquo; explained another,
&ldquo;from Fanny, down to little Cecil the baby&mdash;and that
is our great time for talking to her, when one has her all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does she never take you out in the
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! but there are people staying with us then, or
else she goes out with Papa.&nbsp; It is not a regular drive
every day, as it is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate would not have had a drive with Aunt Barbara every day,
for more than she could well say.&nbsp; However, she was discreet
enough not to say so, and asked what they did on other days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we walk with Miss Oswald in the park, and she tells
us stories, or we make them.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t tell stories in
the country, unless we have to walk straight along the drives,
that, as Papa says, we may have some solace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was explained that Miss Oswald was their governess,
and that they were very busy preparing for her birth-day.&nbsp;
They were making a paper-case for her, all themselves, and this
hour was their only time for doing it out of her sight in
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you make it yourselves?&rdquo; said Kate;
&ldquo;one can buy such beauties at the bazaars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but Mamma says a present one has taken pains to
make, is worth a great deal more than what is only bought; for
trouble goes for more than money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one can make nothing but nasty tumble-to-pieces
things,&rdquo; objected Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Lady Mary, in a very odd
merry voice; and the other two, Adelaide and Grace, who were far
too much alike for Kate to guess which was which, began in a
rather offended manner to assure her that <i>their</i> paper-case
was to be anything but tumble-to-pieces.&nbsp; Fanny was to bind
it, and Papa had promised to paste its back and press it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mamma drove with me to Richmond, on purpose to get
leaves to spatter,&rdquo; added the other sister.</p>
<p>Then they showed Kate&mdash;whose eyes brightened at anything
approaching to a mess&mdash;that they had a piece of coloured
cardboard, on which leaves, chiefly fern, were pinned tightly
down, and that the entire sheet was then covered with a
spattering of ink from a tooth-brush drawn along the tooth of a
comb.&nbsp; When the process was completed, the form of the loaf
remained in the primitive colour of the card, thrown out by the
cloud of ink-spots, and only requiring a tracing of its veins by
a pen.</p>
<p>A space had been cleared for these operations on a side-table;
and in spite of the newspaper, on which the appliances were laid,
and even the comb and brush, there was no look of disarrangement
or untidiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do&mdash;do show me how you do it!&rdquo; cried
Kate, who had had nothing to do for months, with the dear delight
of making a mess, except what she could contrive with her
paints.</p>
<p>And Lady Grace resumed a brown-holland apron and bib, and
opening her hands with a laugh, showed their black insides, then
took up her implements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do&mdash;do let me try,&rdquo; was Kate&rsquo;s
next cry; &ldquo;one little bit to show Sylvia
Wardour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one voice the three sisters protested that she had better
not; she was not properly equipped, and would ink herself all
over.&nbsp; If she would pin down a leaf upon the scrap she held
up, Grace should spatter it for her, and they would make it up
into anything she liked.</p>
<p>But this did not satisfy Kate at all; the pinning out of the
leaf was stupid work compared with the glory of making the ink
fly.&nbsp; In vain did Adelaide represent that all the taste and
skill was in the laying out the leaves, and pinning them down,
and that anyone could put on the ink; in vain did Mary represent
the dirtiness of the work: this was the beauty of it in her eyes;
and the sight of the black dashes sputtering through the comb
filled her with emulation; so that she entreated, almost
piteously, to be allowed to &ldquo;do&rdquo; an ivy loaf, which
she had hastily, and not very carefully, pinned out with
Mary&rsquo;s assistance&mdash;that is, she had feebly and
unsteadily stuck every pin, and Mary had steadied them.</p>
<p>The new friends consented, seeing how much she was set on it;
but Fanny, who had returned from the nursery, insisted on
precautions&mdash;took off the jacket, turned up the frock
sleeves, and tied on an apron; though Kate fidgeted all the time,
as if a great injury were being inflicted on her; and really, in
her little frantic spirit, thought Lady Fanny a great torment,
determined to delay her delight till her aunt should go away and
put a stop to it.</p>
<p>When once she had the brush, she was full of fun and
merriment, and kept her friends much amused by her droll talk,
half to them, half to her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a portentous cloud, isn&rsquo;t
there?&nbsp; An inky cloud, if ever there was one!&nbsp; Take
care, inhabitants below; growl, growl, there&rsquo;s the thunder;
now comes the rain; hail, hail, all hail, like the beginning of
Macbeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which the Frenchman said was in compliment to the
climate,&rdquo; said Fanny; at which the whole company fell into
convulsions of laughing; and neither Kate nor Grace exactly knew
what hands or brush or comb were about; but whereas the little De
La Poers had from their infancy laughed almost noiselessly, and
without making faces, Kate for her misfortune had never been
broken of a very queer contortion of her lips, and a cackle like
a bantam hen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When this unlucky cackle had been several times repeated, it
caused Lady Barbara, who had been sitting with her back to the
inner room, to turn round.</p>
<p>Poor Lady Barbara!&nbsp; It would not be easy to describe her
feelings when she saw the young lady, whom she had brought
delicately blue and white, like a speedwell flower, nearly as
black as a sweep.</p>
<p>Lord de la Poer broke out into an uncontrollable laugh, half
at the aunt, half at the niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, she has grown a
moustache!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Girls, what have you
been doing to her?&rdquo; and walking up to them, he turned Kate
round to a mirror, where she beheld her own brown eyes looking
out of a face dashed over with black specks, thicker about the
mouth, giving her altogether much the colouring of a very dark
man closely shaved.&nbsp; It was so exceedingly comical, that she
went off into fits of laughing, in which she was heartily joined
by all the merry party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer, &ldquo;do you want
to know what your Uncle Giles is like? you&rsquo;ve only to look
at yourself!&mdash;See, Barbara, is it not a capital
likeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought her like <i>Giles</i>,&rdquo; said her
aunt gravely, with an emphasis on the name, as if she meant that
the child did bear a likeness that was really painful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;you should not
have put her in such a condition; could you not have been more
careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate expected one of them to say, &ldquo;She would do it in
spite of us;&rdquo; but instead of that Fanny only answered,
&ldquo;It is not so bad as it looks, Mamma; I believe her frock
is quite safe; and we will soon have her face and hands
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Kate turned round and said, &ldquo;It is all my
fault, and <i>nobody&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; They told me
not, but it was such fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And therewith she obeyed a pull from Grace, and ran upstairs
with the party to be washed; and as the door shut behind them,
Lord de la Poer said, &ldquo;You need not be afraid of
<i>that</i> likeness, Barbara.&nbsp; Whatever else she may have
brought from her parsonage, she has brought the spirit of
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though knowing that something awful hung over her head, Kate
was all the more resolved to profit by her brief minutes of
enjoyment; and the little maidens all went racing and flying
along the passages together; Kate feeling as if the rapid motion
among the other young feet was life once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! your frock is all right; I hope your aunt will
not be very angry with you,&rdquo; said Adelaide.&nbsp; (She know
Adelaide now, for Grace was the inky one.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a thing to be angry for,&rdquo; added
Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it would not have been at my home,&rdquo; said
Kate, with a sigh; &ldquo;but, oh! I hope she will not keep me
from coming here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall not,&rdquo; exclaimed Adelaide; &ldquo;Papa
won&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said your mamma would mind what your papa did
not,&rdquo; said Kate, who was not very well informed on the
nature of mammas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all stuff,&rdquo; decidedly cried
Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;When Papa told us about you, she said,
&lsquo;Poor child!&nbsp; I wish I had her here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prudent Fanny made an endeavour at chocking her little sister;
but the light in Kate&rsquo;s eye, and the responsive face, drew
Grace on to ask, &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t punish you, I hope, for
your tumbling off the bracket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your papa made her promise not; but she was very
cross.&nbsp; Did he tell you about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; and what do you think Ernest wrote?&nbsp; You
must know he had grumbled excessively at Papa&rsquo;s having
business with Lady Barbara; but his letter said, &lsquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t at all slow at Lady Barbara&rsquo;s, for there was
the jolliest fellow there you ever knew; mind you get her to play
at acting.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Fanny did not think this improving, and was very glad
that the maid came in with hot water and towels, and put an end
to it with the work of scrubbing.</p>
<p>Going home, Lady Barbara was as much displeased as Kate had
expected, and with good reason.&nbsp; After all her pains, it was
very strange that Katharine should be so utterly unfit to behave
like a well-bred girl.&nbsp; There might have been excuse for her
before she had been taught, but now it was mere obstinacy.</p>
<p>She should be careful how she took her out for a long time to
come!</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart swelled within her.&nbsp; It was not
obstinacy, she know; and that bit of injustice hindered her from
seeing that it was really wilful recklessness.&nbsp; She was
elated with Ernest&rsquo;s foolish school-boy account of her,
which a more maidenly little girl would not have relished; she
was strengthened in her notion that she was ill-used, by hearing
that the De la Poers pitied her; and because she found that Aunt
Barbara was considered to be a little wrong, she did not consider
that she herself had ever been wrong at all.</p>
<p>And Lady Barbara was not far from the truth when she told her
sister &ldquo;that Katharine was perfectly hard and reckless;
there was no such thing as making her sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> that first visit, Kate did
see something of the De la Poers, but not more than enough to
keep her in a constant ferment with the uncertain possibility,
and the longing for the meetings.</p>
<p>The advances came from them; Lady Barbara said very truly,
that she could not be responsible for making so naughty a child
as her niece the companion of any well-regulated children; she
was sure that their mother could not wish it, since nice and good
as they naturally were, this unlucky Katharine seemed to infect
them with her own spirit of riot and turbulence whenever they
came near her.</p>
<p>There was no forwarding of the attempts to make appointments
for walks in the Park, though really very little harm had ever
come of them, guarded by the two governesses, and by Lady
Fanny&rsquo;s decided ideas of propriety.&nbsp; That Kate
embarked in long stories, and in their excitement raised her
voice, was all that could be said against her on those occasions,
and Mrs. Lacy forbore to say it.</p>
<p>Once, indeed, Kate was allowed to ask her friends to tea; but
that proved a disastrous affair.&nbsp; Fanny was prevented from
coming; and in the absence of her quiet elder-sisterly care, the
spirits of Grace and Adelaide were so excited by Kate&rsquo;s
drollery, that they were past all check from Mary, and drew her
along with them into a state of frantic fun and mad pranks.</p>
<p>They were full of merriment all tea time, even in the presence
of the two governesses; and when that was over, and Kate showed
&ldquo;the bracket,&rdquo; they began to grow almost ungovernable
in their spirit of frolic and fun: they went into Kate&rsquo;s
room, resolved upon being desert travellers, set up an umbrella
hung round with cloaks for a tent, made camels of chairs, and
finding those tardy, attempted riding on each other&mdash;with
what results to Aunt Jane&rsquo;s ears below may be
imagined&mdash;dressed up wild Arabs in bournouses of shawls, and
made muskets of parasols, charging desperately, and shrieking for
attack, defence, &ldquo;for triumph or despair,&rdquo; as Kate
observed, in one of her magnificent quotations.&nbsp; Finally,
the endangered traveller, namely Grace, rushed down the stairs
headlong, with the two Arabs clattering after him, banging with
their muskets, and shouting their war-cry the whole height of the
house.</p>
<p>The ladies in the drawing-room had borne a good deal; but Aunt
Jane was by this time looking meekly distracted; and Lady Barbara
sallying out, met the Arab Sheikh with his white frock over his
head, descending the stairs in the rear, calling to his tribe in
his sweet voice not to be so noisy&mdash;but not seeing before
him through the said bournouse, he had very nearly struck Lady
Barbara with his parasol before he saw her.</p>
<p>No one could be more courteous or full of apologies than the
said Sheikh, who was in fact a good deal shocked at his unruly
tribe, and quite acquiesced in the request that they would all
come and sit quiet in the drawing-room, and play at some suitable
game there.</p>
<p>It would have been a relief to Mary to have them thus disposed
of safely; and Adelaide would have obeyed; but the other two had
been worked up to a state of wildness, such as befalls little
girls who have let themselves out of the control of their better
sense.</p>
<p>They did not see why they should sit up stupid in the
drawing-room; &ldquo;Mary was as cross as Lady Barbara herself to
propose it,&rdquo; said Grace, unfortunately just as the lady
herself was on the stairs to enforce her desire, in her gravely
courteous voice; whereupon Kate, half tired and wholly excited,
burst out into a violent passionate fit of crying and sobbing,
declaring that it was very hard, that whenever she had ever so
little pleasure, Aunt Barbara always grudged it to her.</p>
<p>None of them had ever heard anything like it; to the little De
la Poers she seemed like one beside herself, and Grace clung to
Mary, and Adelaide to Miss Oswald, almost frightened at the
screams and sobs that Kate really could not have stopped if she
would.&nbsp; Lady Jane came to the head of the stairs, pale and
trembling, begging to know who was hurt; and Mrs. Lacy tried
gentle reasoning and persuading, but she might as well have
spoken to the storm beating against the house.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara sternly ordered her off to her room; but the
child did not stir&mdash;indeed, she could not, except that she
rocked herself to and fro in her paroxysms of sobbing, which
seemed to get worse and worse every moment.&nbsp; It was Miss
Oswald at last, who, being more used to little girls and their
naughtiness than any of the others, saw the right moment at last,
and said, as she knelt down by her, half kindly, half severely,
&ldquo;My dear, you had better let me take you up-stairs.&nbsp; I
will help you: and you are only shocking everyone
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did let her take her up-stairs, though at every step
there was a pause, a sob, a struggle; but a gentle hand on her
shoulder, and firm persuasive voice in her ear, moved her
gradually onwards, till the little pink room was gained; and
there she threw herself on her bed in another agony of wild subs,
unaware of Miss Oswald&rsquo;s parley at the door with Lady
Barbara and Mrs. Lacy, and her entreaty that the patient might be
left to her, which they were nothing loth to do.</p>
<p>When Kate recovered her speech, she poured out a wild and very
naughty torrent, about being the most unhappy girl in the world;
the aunts were always unkind to her; she never got any pleasure;
she could not bear being a countess; she only wanted to go back
to her old home, to Papa and Mary and Sylvia; and nobody would
help her.</p>
<p>Miss Oswald treated the poor child almost as if she had been a
little out of her mind, let her say it all between her sobs, and
did not try to argue with her, but waited till the talking and
the sobbing had fairly tried her out; and by that time the hour
had come at which the little visitors were to go home.&nbsp; The
governess rose up, and said she must go, asking in a quiet tone,
as if all that had been said were mere mad folly, whether Lady
Caergwent would come down with her, and tell her aunts she was
sorry for the disturbance she had made.</p>
<p>Kate shrank from showing such a spectacle as her swollen,
tear-stained, red-marbled visage.&nbsp; She was thoroughly sorry,
and greatly ashamed; and she only gasped out, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t; don&rsquo;t let me see
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will wish Mary and her sisters good-bye for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kate had no words for more of
her sorrow and shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I say anything to your aunt for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know; only don&rsquo;t let anyone
come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall I tell Lady Barbara you are too much tired
out now for talking, but that you will tell her in the morning
how sorry you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Kate rather grudgingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, must you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I must, my dear.&nbsp; Their mamma does not
like Addie and Grace to be kept up later than their usual
bed-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could stay.&nbsp; I wish you were my
governess,&rdquo; said Kate, clinging to her, and receiving her
kind, friendly, pitying kiss.</p>
<p>And when the door had shut upon her, Kate&rsquo;s tears began
to drop again at the thought that it was very hard that the
little De la Poers, who had father, mother, and each other,
should likewise have such a nice governess, while she had only
poor sad dull Mrs. Lacy.</p>
<p>Had Kate only known what an unselfish little girl and Mrs.
Lacy might have been to each other!</p>
<p>However, the first thing she could now think of was to avoid
being seen or spoken to by anyone that night; and for this
purpose she hastily undressed herself, bundled-up her hair as
best she might, as in former days, said her prayers, and tumbled
into bed, drawing the clothes over her head, resolved to give no
sign of being awake, come who might.</p>
<p>Her shame was real, and very great.&nbsp; Such violent crying
fits had overtaken her in past times, but had been thought to be
outgrown.&nbsp; She well recollected the last.&nbsp; It was just
after the death of her aunt, Mrs. Wardour, just when the strange
stillness of sorrow in the house was beginning to lessen, and the
children had forgotten themselves, and burst out into noise and
merriment, till they grew unrestrained and quarrelsome; Charlie
had offended Kate, she had struck him, and Mary coming on them,
grieved and hurt at their conduct at such a time, had punished
Kate for the blow, but missed perception of Charlie&rsquo;s
offence; and the notion of injustice had caused the shrieking
cries and violent sobs that had brought Mr. Wardour from the
study in grave sorrowful severity.</p>
<p>What she had heard afterwards from him about not making poor
Mary&rsquo;s task harder, and what she had heard from Mary about
not paining him, had really restrained her; and she had thought
such outbreaks passed by among the baby faults she had left
behind, and was the more grieved and ashamed in
consequence.&nbsp; She felt it a real exposure: she remembered
her young friends&rsquo; surprised and frightened eyes, and not
only had no doubt their mother would really think her too naughty
to be their playfellow, but almost wished that it might be
so&mdash;she could never, never bear to see them again.</p>
<p>She heard the street door close after them, she heard the
carriage drive away; she felt half relieved; but then she hid her
face in the pillow, and cried more quietly, but more
bitterly.</p>
<p>Then some one knocked; she would not answer.&nbsp; Then came a
voice, saying, &ldquo;Katharine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Aunt
Barbara&rsquo;s, but it was rather wavering.&nbsp; She would not
answer, so the door was opened, and the steps, scarcely audible
in the rustling of the silk, came in; and Kate felt that her aunt
was looking at her, wondered whether she had better put out her
head, ask pardon, and have it over, but was afraid; and presently
heard the moir&eacute; antique go sweeping away again.</p>
<p>And then the foolish child heartily wished she had spoken, and
was seized with desperate fears of the morrow, more of the shame
of hearing of her tears than of any punishment.&nbsp; Why had she
not been braver?</p>
<p>After a time came a light, and Josephine moving about quietly,
and putting away the clothes that had been left on the
floor.&nbsp; Kate was not afraid of her, but her caressing
consolations and pity would have only added to the miserable
sense of shame; so there was no sign, no symptom of being awake,
though it was certain that before Josephine went away, the candle
was held so as to cast a light over all that was visible of the
face.&nbsp; Kate could not help hearing the low muttering of the
Frenchwoman, who was always apt to talk to herself:
&ldquo;Asleep!&nbsp; Ah, yes!&nbsp; She sleeps profoundly.&nbsp;
How ugly <i>la petite</i> has made herself!&nbsp; What
cries!&nbsp; Ah, she is like Miladi her aunt! a demon of a
temper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate restrained herself till the door was shut again, and then
rolled over and over, till she had made a strange entanglement of
her bed-clothes, and brought her passion to an end by making a
mummy of herself, bound hand and foot, snapping with her month
all the time, as if she longed to bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you horrible Frenchwoman!&nbsp; You are a flatterer,
a base flatterer; such as always haunt the great!&nbsp; I hate it
all.&nbsp; I a demon of a temper?&nbsp; I like Aunt
Barbara?&nbsp; Oh, you wretch!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell Aunt Barbara
a to-morrow, and get you sent away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were some of Kate&rsquo;s fierce angry thoughts in her
first vexation; but with all her faults, she was not a child who
ever nourished rancour or malice; and though she had been
extremely wounded at first, yet she quickly forgave.</p>
<p>By the time she had smoothed out her sheet, and settled
matters between it and her blanket, she had begun to think more
coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It would be
horribly dishonourable and all that to tell Aunt Barbara.&nbsp;
Josephine was only thinking out loud; and she can&rsquo;t help
what she thinks.&nbsp; I was very naughty; no wonder she thought
so.&nbsp; Only next time she pets me, I will say to her,
&lsquo;You cannot deceive me, Josephine; I like the plain truth
better than honeyed words.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now that Kate had arrived at the composition of a fine
speech that would never be made, it was plain that her mind was
pretty well composed.&nbsp; That little bit of forgiveness,
though it had not even cost an effort, had been softening,
soothing, refreshing; it had brought peacefulness; and Kate lay,
not absolutely asleep, but half dreaming, in the summer twilight,
in the soft undefined fancies of one tired out with
agitation.</p>
<p>She was partly roused by the various sounds in the house, but
not startled&mdash;the light nights of summer always diminished
her alarms; and she heard the clocks strike, and the bell ring
for prayers, the doors open and shut, all mixed in with her hazy
fancies.&nbsp; At last came the silken rustlings up the stairs
again, and the openings of bed-room doors close to her.</p>
<p>Kate must have gone quite to sleep, for she did not know when
the door was opened, and how the soft voices had come in that she
heard over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little dear!&nbsp; How she has tossed her bed
about!&nbsp; I wonder if we could set the clothes straight
without wakening her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How very sweet and gentle Aunt Jane&rsquo;s voice was in that
low cautious whisper.</p>
<p>Some one&mdash;and Kate knew the peculiar sound of Mrs.
Lacy&rsquo;s crape&mdash;was moving the bed-clothes as gently as
she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little dear!&rdquo; again said Lady Jane;
&ldquo;it is very sad to see a child who has cried herself to
sleep.&nbsp; I do wish we could manage her better.&nbsp; Do you
think the child is happy?&rdquo; she ended by asking in a wistful
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has very high spirits,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! her impetuosity; it is her misfortune, poor
child!&nbsp; Barbara is so calm and resolute,
that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Was Lady Jane really going to
regret anything in her sister?&nbsp; She did not say it, however;
but Kate heard her sigh, and add, &ldquo;Ah, well! if I were
stronger, perhaps we could make her happier; but I am so
nervous.&nbsp; I must try not to look distressed when her spirits
do break out, for perhaps it is only natural.&nbsp; And I am so
sorry to have brought all this on her, and spoilt those poor
children&rsquo;s pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Jane bent over the child, and Kate reared herself up on a
sudden, threw her arms round her neck, and whispered, &ldquo;Aunt
Jane, dear Aunt Jane, I&rsquo;ll try never to frighten you
again!&nbsp; I am so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there; have I waked you?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t, my
dear; your aunt will hear.&nbsp; Go to sleep again.&nbsp; Yes,
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Aunt Jane was kissing and fondling all the time; and the
end of this sad naughty evening was, that Kate went to sleep with
more softness, love, and repentance in her heart, than there had
been since her coming to Bruton Street.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Caergwent</span> was thoroughly
ashamed and bumbled by that unhappy evening.&nbsp; She looked so
melancholy and subdued in the morning, with her heavy eyelids and
inflamed eyes, and moved so meekly and sadly, without daring to
look up, that Lady Barbara quite pitied her, and said&mdash;more
kindly than she had ever spoken to her before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are sorry for the exposure last night, so we
will say no more about it.&nbsp; I will try to forget it.&nbsp; I
hope our friends may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That hope sounded very much like &ldquo;I do not think they
will;&rdquo; and truly Kate felt that it was not in the nature of
things that they ever should.&nbsp; She should never have
forgotten the sight of a little girl in that frenzy of
passion!&nbsp; No, she was sure that their mamma and papa knew
all about it, and that she should never be allowed to play with
them again, and she could not even wish to meet them, she should
be miserably ashamed, and would not know which way to look.</p>
<p>She said not one word about meeting them, and for the first
day or two even begged to walk in the square instead of the park;
and she was so good and steady with her lessons, and so quiet in
her movements, that she scarcely met a word of blame for a whole
week.</p>
<p>One morning, while she was at breakfast with Lady Barbara and
Mrs. Lacy, the unwonted sound of a carriage stopping, and of a
double knock, was heard.&nbsp; In a moment the colour flushed
into Lady Barbara&rsquo;s face, and her eyes lighted: then it
passed away into a look of sadness.&nbsp; It had seemed to her
for a moment as if the bright young nephew who had been the light
and hope of her life, were going to look in on her; and it had
only brought the remembrance that he was gone for ever, and that
in his stead there was only the poor little girl, to whom rank
was a misfortune, and who seemed as if she would never wear it
becomingly.&nbsp; Kate saw nothing of all this; she was only
eager and envious for some change and variety in these long dull
days.&nbsp; It was Lord de la Poer and his daughter Adelaide, who
the next moment were in the room; and she remembered instantly
that she had heard that this was to be Adelaide&rsquo;s birthday,
and wished her many happy returns in all due form, her heart
beating the while with increasing hope that the visit concerned
herself.</p>
<p>And did it not?&nbsp; Her head swam round with delight and
suspense, and she could hardly gather up the sense of the words
in which Lord de la Poer was telling Lady Barbara that
Adelaide&rsquo;s birthday was to be spent at the Crystal Palace
at Sydenham; that the other girls were gone to the station with
their mother, and that he had come round with Adelaide to carry
off Kate, and meet the rest at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Lady de
la Poer would have written, but it had only boon settled that
morning on finding that he could spare the day.</p>
<p>Kate squeezed Adelaide&rsquo;s hand in an agony.&nbsp; Oh!
would that aunt let her go?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to come?&rdquo; asked Lord de la Poer,
bending his pleasant eyes on her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever been
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; Oh, thank you!&nbsp; I should like it so
much!&nbsp; I never saw any exhibition at all, except once the
Gigantic Cabbage!&mdash;May I go, Aunt Barbara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really you are very kind, after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we never think of <i>afters</i> on
birthdays!&mdash;Do we, Addie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are so very good, perhaps Mrs. Lacy will kindly
bring her to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said he, turning courteously to that
lady, &ldquo;that we should be very sorry to give Mrs. Lacy so
much trouble.&nbsp; If this is to be a holiday to everyone, I am
sure you would prefer the quiet day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could look at the sad face and widow&rsquo;s cap
without feeling that so it must be, even without the embarrassed
&ldquo;Thank you, my Lord, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if Katharine were more to be trusted,&rdquo;
began Lady Barbara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Barbara,&rdquo; he said in a drolly serious
fashion, &ldquo;if you think the Court of Chancery would
seriously object, say so at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barbara could not keep the corners of her mouth quite
stiff, but she still said, &ldquo;You do not know what you are
undertaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you deliberately tell me that you think myself and
Fanny, to say nothing of young Fanny, who is the wisest of us
all, unfit to be trusted with this one young lady?&rdquo; said
he, looking her full in the face, and putting on a most comical
air: &ldquo;It is humiliating, I own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! if Katharine were like your own daughters, I should
have no fears,&rdquo; said the aunt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;&nbsp; However, since you are so good&mdash;if
she will promise to be very careful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, yes, Aunt Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make myself responsible,&rdquo; said Lord de la
Poer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, young woman, run off and get the hat; we
have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate darted off and galloped up the stairs at a furious pace,
shouted &ldquo;Josephine&rdquo; at the top; and then, receiving
no answer, pulled the bell violently; after which she turned
round, and obliged Adelaide with a species of dancing hug, rather
to the detriment of that young lady&rsquo;s muslin jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to look back before,&rdquo; she
breathlessly said, as she released Adelaide; &ldquo;I felt as if
your papa were Orpheus, when</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Stern Proserpine relented,<br />
And gave him back the fair&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I was sure Aunt Barbara would catch me like Eurydice, if I
only looked back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a funny girl you are, to be thinking about Orpheus
and Eurydice!&rdquo; said Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad?&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I just! as Charlie would
say.&nbsp; Oh dear! your papa is a delicious man; I&rsquo;d
rather have him for mine than anybody, except Uncle
Wardour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have him than anyone,&rdquo; said the
little daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because he is yours,&rdquo; said
Kate; &ldquo;but somehow, though he is more funny and
good-natured than Uncle Wardour, I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, I
shouldn&rsquo;t like him so well for a papa.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think he would punish so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punish!&rdquo; cried Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that
what you want?&nbsp; Why, Mamma says children ought to be always
pleasure and no trouble to busy fathers.&nbsp; But there, Kate;
you are not getting ready&mdash;and we are to be at the station
at ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting for Josephine!&nbsp; Why doesn&rsquo;t she
come?&rdquo; said Kate, ringing violently again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get ready without her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where anything is!&nbsp; It is very
tiresome of her, when she knows I never dress myself,&rdquo; said
Kate fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Why, Grace and I always dress
ourselves, except for the evening.&nbsp; Let me help you.&nbsp;
Are not those your boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate rushed to the bottom of the attic stairs, and shouted
&ldquo;Josephine&rdquo; at the top of her shrill voice; then,
receiving no answer, she returned, condescended to put on the
boots that Adelaide held up to her, and noisily pulled out some
drawers; but not seeing exactly what she wanted, she again betook
herself to screams of her maid&rsquo;s name, at the third of
which out burst Mrs. Bartley in a regular state of indignation:
&ldquo;Lady Caergwent!&nbsp; Will your Ladyship hold your
tongue!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Lady Jane startled up, and it&rsquo;s
a mercy if her nerves recover it the whole day&mdash;making such
a noise as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Josephine won&rsquo;t come, and I&rsquo;m going
out, Bartley,&rdquo; said Kate piteously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is
Josephine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone out, my Lady, so it is no use making a piece of
work,&rdquo; said Bartley crossly, retreating to Lady Jane.</p>
<p>Kate was ready to cry; but behold, that handy little Adelaide
had meantime picked out a nice black silk cape, with hat and
feather, gloves and handkerchief, which, if not what Kate had
intended, were nice enough for anything, and would
have&mdash;some months ago&mdash;seemed to the orphan at the
parsonage like robes of state.&nbsp; Kind Adelaide held them up
so triumphantly, that Kate could not pout at their being only
everyday things; and as she began to put them on, out came Mrs.
Bartley again, by Lady Jane&rsquo;s orders, pounced upon Lady
Caergwent, and made her repent of all wishes for assistance by
beginning upon her hair, and in spite of all wriggles and
remonstrances, dressing her in the peculiarly slow and precise
manner by which a maid can punish a troublesome child; until
finally Kate&mdash;far too much irritated for a word of thanks,
tore herself out of her hands, caught up her gloves, and flew
down-stairs as if her life depended on her speed.&nbsp; She
thought the delay much longer than it had really been, for she
found Lord de la Poer talking so earnestly to her aunt, that he
hardly looked up when she came in&mdash;something about her Uncle
Giles in India, and his coming home&mdash;which seemed to be
somehow becoming possible&mdash;though at a great loss to
himself; but there was no making it out; and in a few minutes he
rose, and after some fresh charges from Lady Barbara to her niece
&ldquo;not to forgot herself,&rdquo; Kate was handed into the
carriage, and found herself really off.</p>
<p>Then the tingle of wild impatience and suspense subsided, and
happiness began!&nbsp; It had not been a good beginning, but it
was very charming now.</p>
<p>Adelaide and her father were full of jokes together, so quick
and bright that Kate listened instead of talking.&nbsp; She had
almost lost the habit of merry chatter, and it did not come to
her quickly again; but she was greatly entertained; and thus they
came to the station, where Lady de la Poer and her other three
girls were awaiting them, and greeted Kate with joyful faces.</p>
<p>They were the more relieved at the arrival of the three,
because the station was close and heated, and it was a very warm
summer day, so that the air was extremely oppressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels like thunder,&rdquo; said some one.&nbsp; And
thenceforth Kate&rsquo;s perfect felicity was clouded.&nbsp; She
had a great dislike to a thunder-storm, and she instantly began
asking her neighbours if they <i>really</i> thought it would be
thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will,&rdquo; said Lady Fanny; &ldquo;it would
cool the air, and sound so grand in those domes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate thought this savage, and with an imploring look asked
Lady de la Poer if she thought there would be a storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the least sign of one,&rdquo; was the
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;See how clear the sky is!&rdquo; as they
steamed out of the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think there will be one to-day?&rdquo;
demanded Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not expect it,&rdquo; said Lady de la Poer,
smiling; &ldquo;and there is no use in expecting
disagreeables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disagreeables!&nbsp; O Mamma, it would be such
fun,&rdquo; cried Grace, &ldquo;if we only had a chance of
getting wet through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Lord de la Poer adroitly called off the public attention
from the perils of the clouds, by declaring that he wanted to
make out the fourth line of an advertisement on the banks, of
which he said he had made out one line as he was whisked by on
each journey he had made; and as it was four times over in four
different languages, he required each damsel to undertake one;
and there was a great deal of laughing over which it should be
that should undertake each language.&nbsp; Fanny and Mary were
humble, and sure they could never catch the German; and Kate,
more enterprising, undertook the Italian.&nbsp; After all, while
they were chattering about it, they went past the valuable
document, and were come in sight of the &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; in
the Gardens; and Lord de la Poer asked Kate if she would like to
catch a pretty little frog; to which Mary responded, &ldquo;Oh,
what a tadpole it must have been!&rdquo; and the discovery that
her friends had once kept a preserve of tadpoles to watch them
turn into frogs, was so delightful as entirely to dissipate all
remaining thoughts of thunder, and leave Kate free for almost
breathless amazement at the glittering domes of glass, looking
like enormous bubbles in the sun.</p>
<p>What a morning that was, among the bright buds and flowers,
the wonders of nature and art all together!&nbsp; It was to be a
long day, and no hurrying; so the party went from court to court
at their leisure, sat down, and studied all that they cared for,
or divided according to their tastes.&nbsp; Fanny and Mary wanted
time for the wonderful sculptures on the noble gates in the
Italian court; but the younger girls preferred roaming more
freely, so Lady de la Poer sat down to take care of them, while
her husband undertook to guide the wanderings of the other
three.</p>
<p>He particularly devoted himself to Kate, partly in courtesy as
to the guest of the party, partly because, as he said, he felt
himself responsible for her; and she was in supreme enjoyment,
talking freely to one able and willing to answer her remarks and
questions, and with the companionship of girls of her own age
besides.&nbsp; She was most of all delighted with the
Alhambra&mdash;the beauty of it was to her like a fairy tale; and
she had read Washington Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Siege of
Granada,&rdquo; so that she could fancy the courts filled with
the knightly Moors, who were so noble that she could not think
why they were not Christians&mdash;nay, the tears quite came into
her eyes as she looked up in Lord de la Poer&rsquo;s face, and
asked why nobody converted the Abencerrages instead of fighting
with them!</p>
<p>It was a pity that Kate always grew loud when she was earnest;
and Lord de la Poer&rsquo;s interest in the conversation was
considerably lessened by the discomfort of seeing some strangers
looking surprised at the five syllables in the squeaky voice
coming out of the mouth of so small a lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, my dear,&rdquo; he softly said; and Kate for a
moment felt it hard that the torment about her voice should
pursue her even in such moments, and spoil the Alhambra
itself.</p>
<p>However, her good humour recovered the next minute, at the
Fountain of Lions.&nbsp; She wanted to know how the Moors came to
have lions; she thought she had heard that no Mahometans were
allowed to represent any living creature, for fear it should be
an idol.&nbsp; Lord de la Poer said she was quite right, and that
the Mahometans think these forms will come round their makers at
the last day, demanding to have souls given to them; but that her
friends, the Moors of Spain, were much less strict than any
others of their faith.&nbsp; She could see, however, that the
carving of such figures was a new art with them, since these
lions were very rude and clumsy performances for people who could
make such delicate tracery as they had seen within.&nbsp; And
then, while Kate was happily looking with Adelaide at the orange
trees that completed the Spanish air of the court, and hoping to
see the fountain play in the evening, he told Grace that it was
worth while taking people to see sights if they had as much
intelligence and observation as Kate had, and did not go gazing
idly about, thinking of nothing.</p>
<p>He meant it to stir up his rather indolent-minded
Grace&mdash;he did not mean the countess to hear it; but some
people&rsquo;s eyes and ears are wonderfully quick at gathering
what is to their own credit, and Kate, who had not heard a bit of
commendation for a long time, was greatly elated.</p>
<p>Luckily for appearances, she remembered how Miss
Edgeworth&rsquo;s Frank made himself ridiculous by showing off to
Mrs. J&mdash;, and how she herself had once been overwhelmed by
the laughter of the Wardour family for having rehearsed to poor
Mrs. Brown all the characters of the gods of the
Northmen&mdash;Odin, Thor, and all&mdash;when she had just learnt
them.&nbsp; So she was more careful than before not to pour out
all the little that she knew; and she was glad she had not
committed herself, for she had very nearly volunteered the
information that Pompeii was overwhelmed by Mount Etna, before
she heard some one say Vesuvius, and perceived her mistake,
feeling as if she had been rewarded for her modesty like a good
child in a book.</p>
<p>She applauded herself much more for keeping back her knowledge
till it was wanted, than for having it; but this
self-satisfaction looked out in another loop-hole.&nbsp; She
avoided pedantry, but she was too much elated not to let her
spirits get the better of her; and when Lady de la Poer and the
elder girls came up, they found her in a suppressed state of
capering, more like a puppy on its hind logs, than like a
countess or any other well-bred child.</p>
<p>The party met under the screen of kings and queens, and there
had some dinner, at one of the marble tables that just held them
pleasantly.&nbsp; The cold chicken and tongue were wonderfully
good on that hot hungry day, and still better were the
strawberries that succeeded them; and oh! what mirth went on all
the time!&nbsp; Kate was chattering fastest of all, and
loudest&mdash;not to say the most nonsensically.&nbsp; It was not
nice nonsense&mdash;that was the worst of it&mdash;it was pert
and saucy.&nbsp; It was rather the family habit to laugh at Mary
de la Poer for ways that were thought a little fanciful; and Kate
caught this up, and bantered without discretion, in a way not
becoming towards anybody, especially one some years her
elder.&nbsp; Mary was good-humoured, but evidently did not like
being asked if she had stayed in the medi&aelig;val court,
because she was afraid the great bulls of Nineveh would run at
her with their five legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be afraid of being teazed by a little goose
another time,&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer, intending to give his
little friend a hint that she was making herself very silly; but
Kate took it quite another way, and not a pretty one, for she
answered, &ldquo;Dear me, Mary, can&rsquo;t you say bo to a
goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; cried Adelaide, who was always apt to
be a good deal excited by Kate; and who had been going off into
fits of laughter at all these foolish sallies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a very nice thing to say,&rdquo; answered her
mother gravely; &ldquo;so there is no occasion to learn
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate did take the hint this time, and coloured up to the ears,
partly with vexation, partly with shame.&nbsp; She sat silent and
confused for several minutes, till her friends took pity on her,
and a few good-natured words about her choice of an ice quite
restored her liveliness.&nbsp; It is well to be good-humoured;
but it is unlucky, nay, wrong, when a check from friends without
authority to scold, does not suffice to bring soberness instead
of rattling giddiness.&nbsp; Lady de la Poer was absolutely glad
to break up the dinner, so as to work off the folly and
excitement by moving about, before it should make the little girl
expose herself, or infect Adelaide.</p>
<p>They intended to have gone into the gardens till four
o&rsquo;clock, when the fountains were to play; but as they moved
towards the great door, they perceived a dark heavy cloud was
hiding the sun that had hitherto shone so dazzlingly through the
crystal walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nice,&rdquo; said Lady Fanny; &ldquo;it will be
cool and pleasant now before the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the rain is not imminent,&rdquo; began her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is it going to be a thunder-storm?&rdquo; cried
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; I do so hate thunder!&nbsp;
What shall I do?&rdquo; cried she; all her excitement turning
into terror.</p>
<p>Before anyone could answer her, there was a flash of bright
white light before all their eyes, and a little scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s struck! she&rsquo;s struck!&rdquo; cried
Adelaide, her hands before her eyes.</p>
<p>For Kate had disappeared.&nbsp; No, she was in the great pond,
beside which they had been standing, and Mary was kneeling on the
edge, holding fast by her frock.&nbsp; But before the deep voice
of the thunder was roaring and reverberating through the vaults,
Lord de la Poer had her in his grasp, and the growl had not
ceased before she was on her feet again, drenched and trembling,
beginning to be the centre of a crowd, who were running together
to help or to see the child who had been either struck by
lightning or drowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she struck?&nbsp; Will she be blind?&rdquo; sobbed
Adelaide, still with her hands before her eyes; and the inquiry
was echoed by the nearer people, while more distant ones told
each other that the young lady was blind for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struck! nonsense!&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer;
&ldquo;the lightning was twenty miles off at least.&nbsp; Are you
hurt, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kate, shaking herself, and answering
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; more decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only I am so wet,
and my things stick to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I wanted to get away from the
thunder!&rdquo; said bewildered Kate.</p>
<p>Meantime, an elderly lady, who had come up among the
spectators, was telling Lady de la Poer that she lived close by,
and insisting that the little girl should be taken at once to her
house, put to bed, and her clothes dried.&nbsp; Lady de la Poer
was thankful to accept the kind offer without loss of time; and
in the fewest possible words it was settled that she would go and
attend to the little drowned rat, while her girls should remain
with their father at the palace till the time of going home, when
they would meet at the station.&nbsp; They must walk to the good
lady&rsquo;s house, be the storm what it would, as the best
chance of preventing Kate from catching cold.&nbsp; She looked a
rueful spectacle, dripping so as to make a little pool on the
stone floor; her hat and feather limp and streaming; her hair in
long lank rats&rsquo; tails, each discharging its own waterfall;
her clothes, ribbons, and all, pasted down upon her!&nbsp; There
was no time to be lost; and the stranger took her by one hand,
Lady de la Poer by the other, and exchanging some civil speeches
with one another half out of breath, they almost swung her from
one step of the grand stone stairs to another, and hurried her
along as fast as these beplastered garments would let her
move.&nbsp; There was no rain as yet, but there was another clap
of thunder much louder than the first; but they held Kate too
fast to let her stop, or otherwise make herself more foolish.</p>
<p>In a very few minutes they were at the good lady&rsquo;s door;
in another minute in her bedroom, where, while she and her maid
bustled off to warm the bed, Lady de la Poer tried to get the
clothes off&mdash;a service of difficulty, when every tie held
fast, every button was slippery, and the tighter garments fitted
like skins.&nbsp; Kate was subdued and frightened; she gave no
trouble, but all the help she gave was to pull a string so as to
make a hopeless knot of the bow that her friend had nearly
undone.</p>
<p>However, by the time the bed was warm the dress was off, and
the child, rolled up in a great loose night-dress of the kind
lady&rsquo;s, was installed in it, feeling&mdash;sultry day
though it were&mdash;that the warm dryness was extremely
comfortable to her chilled limbs.&nbsp; The good lady brought her
some hot tea, and moved away to the window, talking in a low
murmuring voice to Lady de la Poer.&nbsp; Presently a fresh flash
of lightning made her bury her head in the pillow; and there she
began thinking how hard it was that the thunder should come to
spoil her one day&rsquo;s pleasure; but soon stopped this,
remembering Who sends storm and thunder, and feeling afraid to
murmur.&nbsp; Then she remembered that perhaps she deserved to be
disappointed.&nbsp; She had been wild and troublesome, had spoilt
Adelaide&rsquo;s birthday, teazed Mary, and made kind Lady de la
Poer grave and displeased.</p>
<p>She would say how sorry she was, and ask pardon.&nbsp; But the
two ladies still stood talking.&nbsp; She must wait till this
stranger was gone.&nbsp; And while she was waiting&mdash;how it
was she knew not&mdash;but Countess Kate was fast asleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Kate opened her eyes again,
and turned her face up from the pillow, she saw the drops on the
window shining in the sun, and Lady de la Poer, with her bonnet
off, reading under it.</p>
<p>All that had happened began to return on Kate&rsquo;s brain in
a funny medley; and the first thing she exclaimed was, &ldquo;Oh!
those poor little fishes, how I must have frightened
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I did much mischief?&rdquo; said Kate,
raising herself on her arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure the fishes
must have been frightened, and the water-lilies broken.&nbsp; Oh!
you can&rsquo;t think how nasty their great coiling stems
were&mdash;just like snakes!&nbsp; But those pretty blue and pink
flowers!&nbsp; Did it hurt them much, do you think&mdash;or the
fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the fish had recovered the shock,&rdquo;
said Lady de la Poer, smiling; &ldquo;but as to the lilies, I
should be glad to be sure you had done yourself as little harm as
you have to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
hurt&mdash;if Aunt Barbara won&rsquo;t be terribly angry.&nbsp;
Now I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that, only that I&rsquo;ve spoilt
Addie&rsquo;s birthday, and all your day.&nbsp; Please, I&rsquo;m
very sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this so sadly and earnestly, that Lady de la Poer
came and gave her a kind hiss of forgiveness, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, the girls are very happy with their father,
and the rest is good for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate thought this very comfortable and kind, and clung to the
kind hand gratefully; but though it was a fine occasion for one
of the speeches she could have composed in private, all that came
out of her mouth was, &ldquo;How horrid it is&mdash;the way
everything turns out with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, things need not turn out horrid, if a certain
little girl would keep herself from being silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>am</i> a silly little girl!&rdquo; cried Kate
with emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Uncle Wardour says he never saw such
a silly one, and so does Aunt Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady de la Poer very calmly,
&ldquo;when clever people take to being silly, they can be
sillier than anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever people!&rdquo; cried Kate half breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;you are a clever
child; and if you made the most of yourself, you could be very
sensible, and hinder yourself from being foolish and unguarded,
and getting into scrapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate gasped.&nbsp; It was not pleasant to be in a scrape; and
yet her whole self recoiled from being guarded and watchful, even
though for the first time she heard she was not absolutely
foolish.&nbsp; She began to argue, &ldquo;I was naughty, I know,
to teaze Mary; and Mary at home would not have let me; but I
could not help the tumbling into the pond.&nbsp; I wanted to get
out of the way of the lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Kate, you <i>are</i> trying to show how silly you
can make yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t bear thunder and lightning.&nbsp; It
frightens me so, I don&rsquo;t know what to do; and Aunt Jane is
just as bad.&nbsp; She always has the shutters shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Aunt Jane has had her nerves weakened by bad
health; but you are young and strong, and you ought to fight with
fanciful terrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not fancy about lightning.&nbsp; It does kill
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A storm is very awful, and is one of the great
instances of God&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; He does sometimes allow His
lightnings to fall; but I do not think it can be quite the
thought of this that terrifies you, Kate, for the recollection of
His Hand is comforting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kate honestly, &ldquo;it is not
thinking of that.&nbsp; It is that the glare&mdash;coming no one
knows when&mdash;and the great rattling clap are so&mdash;so
frightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear, I think all you can do is to pray not
only for protection from lightning and tempest, but that you may
be guarded from the fright that makes you forget to watch
yourself, and so renders the danger greater!&nbsp; You could not
well have been drowned where you fell; but if it had been a
river&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And try to get self-command.&nbsp; That is the great
thing, after all, that would hinder things from being
horrid!&rdquo; said Lady de la Poer, with a pleasant smile, just
as a knock came to the door, and the maid announced that it was
five o&rsquo;clock, and Miss&rsquo;s things were quite ready; and
in return she was thanked, and desired to bring them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss!&rdquo; said Kate, rather hurt: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
they know who we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not such a creditable adventure that we should
wish to make your name known,&rdquo; said Lady de la Poer, rather
drily; and Kate blushed, and became ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>She was really five minutes before she recovered the use of
her tongue, and that was a long time for her.&nbsp; Lady de la
Poer meantime was helping her to dress, as readily as Josephine
herself could have done, and brushing out the hair, which was
still damp.&nbsp; Kate presently asked where the old lady
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had to go back as soon as the rain was over, to
look after a nephew and niece, who are spending the day with
her.&nbsp; She said she would look for our party, and tell them
how we were getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have spoilt three people&rsquo;s pleasure
more!&rdquo; said Kate ruefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the niece a
little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I fancy her grown up, or they would
have offered clothes to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for not telling my name.&nbsp; Once it would have
been like a fairy tale to Sylvia and me, and have made up for
anything, to see a countess&mdash;especially a little girl.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t you think seeing me would quite spoil
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady de la Poer was so much amused, that she could not answer
at first; and Kate began to feel as if she had been talking
foolishly, and turned her back to wash her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I don&rsquo;t think we are quite as well
worth seeing as the Crystal Palace!&nbsp; You put me in mind of
what Madame Campan said.&nbsp; She had been governess to the
first Napoleon&rsquo;s sisters; and when, in the days of their
grandeur, she visited them, one of them asked her if she was not
awe-struck to find herself among so much royalty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be much
afraid of queens whom I have whipped!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were only mock queens,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true.&nbsp; But, little woman, it is <i>all</i>
mockery, unless it is the <i>self</i> that makes the impression;
and I am afraid being perched upon any kind of pedestal makes
little faults and follies do more harm to others.&nbsp; But come,
put on your hat: we must not keep Papa waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hat was the worst part of the affair; the colour of the
blue edge of the ribbon had run into the white, and the pretty
soft feather had been so daggled in the wet, that an old hen on a
wet day was respectability itself compared with it, and there was
nothing for it but to take it out; and even then the hat reminded
Kate of a certain Amelia Matilda Bunny, whose dirty finery was a
torment and a by-word in St. James&rsquo;s Parsonage.&nbsp; Her
frock and white jacket had been so nicely ironed out, as to show
no traces of the adventure; and she disliked all the more to
disfigure herself with such a thing on her head for the present,
as well as to encounter Aunt Barbara by-and-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; said Lady de la
Poer, seeing her disconsolately surveying it; &ldquo;perhaps it
will not be bad for you to feel a few consequences from your
heedlessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it were the hat or the shock, Kate was uncommonly meek
and subdued as she followed Lady de la Poer out of the room; and
after giving the little maid half a sovereign and many thanks for
having so nicely repaired the damage, they walked back to the
palace, and up the great stone stairs, Kate hanging down her
head, thinking that everyone was wondering how Amelia Matilda
Bunny came to be holding by the hand of a lady in a beautiful
black lace bonnet and shawl, so quiet and simple, and yet such a
lady!</p>
<p>She hardly even looked up when the glad exclamations of the
four girls and their father sounded around her, and she could not
bear their inquiries whether she felt well again.&nbsp; She knew
that she owed thanks to Mary and her father, and apologies to
them all; but she had not manner enough to utter them, and only
made a queer scrape with her foot, like a hen scratching out
corn, hung her head, and answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw she was very much ashamed, and they were in a hurry
besides; so when Lord de la Poer had said he had given all manner
of thanks to the good old lady, he took hold of Kate&rsquo;s
hand, as if he hardly ventured to let go of her again, and they
all made the best of their way to the station, and were soon in
full career along the line, Kate&rsquo;s heart sinking as she
thought of Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; Fanny tried kindly to talk to her;
but she was too anxious to listen, made a short answer, and kept
her eyes fixed on the two heads of the party, who were in close
consultation, rendered private by the noise of the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I answer for anyone again!&rdquo; said Lord de
la Poer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now for facing Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better let me do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you think I am afraid?&rdquo; and Kate thought
the smile on his lip very cruel, as she could not hear his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do you much injustice in thinking
so,&rdquo; as he shrugged up his shoulders like a boy going to be
punished; &ldquo;but I think Barbara considers you as an
accomplice in mischief, and will have more mercy if I
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the man to prevent
you.&nbsp; Tell Barbara I&rsquo;ll undergo whatever she pleases,
for having ever let go the young lady&rsquo;s hand!&nbsp; She may
have me up to the Lord Chancellor if she pleases!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little relaxation in the noise made these words audible; and
Kate, who knew the Lord Chancellor had some power over her, and
had formed her notions of him from a picture, in a history book
at home, of Judge Jefferies holding the Bloody Assize, began to
get very much frightened; and her friends saw her eyes growing
round with alarm, and not knowing the exact cause, pitied her;
Lord de la Poer seated her upon his knee, and told her that Mamma
would take her home, and take care Aunt Barbara did not punish
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will punish me,&rdquo; said
Kate; &ldquo;she does not often!&nbsp; But pray come home with
me!&rdquo; she added, getting hold of the lady&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would she do to you, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would&mdash;only&mdash;be dreadful!&rdquo; said
Kate.</p>
<p>Lord de la Poer laughed; but observed, &ldquo;Well, is it not
enough to make one dreadful to have little girls taking
unexpected baths in public?&nbsp; Now, Kate, please to inform me,
in confidence, what was the occasion of that remarkable
somerset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the lightning,&rdquo; muttered Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I was not certain whether your intention
might not have been to make that polite address to an aquatic
bird, for which you pronounced Mary not to have sufficient
courage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady de la Poer, thinking this a hard trial of the poor
child&rsquo;s temper, was just going to ask him not to tease her;
but Kate was really candid and good tempered, and she said,
&ldquo;I was wrong to say that!&nbsp; It was Mary that had
presence of mind, and I had not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the fruit of the adventure is to be, I hope, Look
Before you Leap!&mdash;Eh, Lady Caergwent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the same time the train stopped, and among kisses and
farewells, Kate and kind Lady de la Poer left the carriage, and
entering the brougham that was waiting for them, drove to Bruton
Street; Kate very grave and silent all the way, and shrinking
behind her friend in hopes that the servant who opened the door
would not observe her plight&mdash;indeed, she took her hat off
on the stairs, and laid it on the table in the landing.</p>
<p>To her surprise, the beginning of what Lady de la Poer said
was chiefly apology for not having taken better care of
her.&nbsp; It was all quite true: there was no false excuse made
for her, she felt, when Aunt Barbara looked ashamed and annoyed,
and said how concerned she was that her niece should be so
unmanageable; and her protector answered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, I assure you!&nbsp; She was a very nice
little companion, and we quite enjoyed her readiness and
intelligent interest; but she was a little too much excited to
remember what she was about when she was startled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; said Lady Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was a most tremendous storm, and I feel quite shaken by it
still.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t be angry with her for being
terrified by it, Barbara dear, or I shall know what you think of
me;&mdash;half drowned too&mdash;poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Aunt Jane put her soft arm round Kate, and put her cheek
to hers.&nbsp; Perhaps the night of Kate&rsquo;s tears had really
made Jane resolved to try to soften even Barbara&rsquo;s
displeasure; and the little girl felt it very kind, though her
love of truth made her cry out roughly, &ldquo;Not half
drowned!&nbsp; Mary held me fast, and Lord de la Poer pulled me
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you ought to be extremely thankful to
them,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, &ldquo;and overcome with shame at
all the trouble and annoyance you have given!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady de la Poer quite understood what the little girl meant by
her aunt being dreadful.&nbsp; She would gladly have protected
her; but it was not what could be begged off like punishment, nor
would truth allow her to say there had been no trouble nor
annoyance.&nbsp; So what she did say was, &ldquo;When one has ten
children, one reckons upon such things!&rdquo; and smiled as if
they were quite pleasant changes to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not, I am sure, with your particularly quiet little
girls,&rdquo; said Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am always hoping
that Katharine may take example by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care what you hope, Barbara,&rdquo; said Lady de
la Poer, smiling: &ldquo;and at any rate forgive this poor little
maiden for our disaster, or my husband will be in
despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Katharine cannot have seriously expected
punishment for what is not a moral fault.&nbsp; The only
difference will be the natural consequences to herself of her
folly.&mdash;You had better go down to the schoolroom, Katharine,
have your tea, and then go to bed; it is nearly the usual
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady de la Poer warmly kissed the child, and then remained a
little while with the aunts, trying to remove what she saw was
the impression, that Kate had been complaining of severe
treatment, and taking the opportunity of telling them what she
herself thought of the little girl.&nbsp; But though Aunt Barbara
listened politely, she could not think that Lady de la Poer knew
anything about the perverseness, heedlessness, ill-temper,
disobedience, and rude ungainly ways, that were so
tormenting.&nbsp; She said no word about them herself, because
she would not expose her niece&rsquo;s faults; but when her
friend talked Kate&rsquo;s bright candid conscientious character,
her readiness, sense, and intelligence, she said to herself, and
perhaps justly, that here was all the difference between at home
and abroad, an authority and a stranger.</p>
<p>Meantime, Kate wondered what would be the natural consequences
of her folly.&nbsp; Would she have a rheumatic fever or
consumption, like a child in a book?&mdash;and she tried
breathing deep, and getting up a little cough, to see if it was
coming!&nbsp; Or would the Lord Chancellor hear of it?&nbsp; He
was new bugbear recently set up, and more haunting than even a
gunpowder treason in the cellars!&nbsp; What did he do with the
seals?&nbsp; Did he seal up mischievous heiresses in closets, as
she had seen a door fastened by two seals and a bit of
string?&nbsp; Perhaps the Court of Chancery was full of such
prisons!&nbsp; And was the woolsack to smother them with, like
the princes in the Tower?</p>
<p>It must be owned that it was only when half asleep at night
that Kate was so absurd.&nbsp; By day she knew very well that the
Lord Chancellor was only a great lawyer; but she also knew that
whenever there was any puzzle or difficulty about her or her
affairs, she always heard something mysteriously said about
applying to the Lord Chancellor, till she began to really suspect
that it was by his commands that Aunt Barbara was so stern with
her; and that if he knew of her fall into the pond, something
terrible would come of it.&nbsp; Perhaps that was why the De la
Poers kept her name so secret!</p>
<p>She trembled as she thought of it; and here was another added
to her many terrors.&nbsp; Poor little girl!&nbsp; If she had
rightly feared and loved One, she would have had no room for the
many alarms that kept her heart fluttering!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be doubted whether Countess
Kate ever did in her childhood discover what her Aunt Barbara
meant by the natural consequences of her folly, but she suffered
from them nevertheless.&nbsp; When the summer was getting past
its height of beauty, and the streets were all sun and misty
heat, and the grass in the parks looked brown, and the rooms were
so close that even Aunt Jane had one window open, Kate grew giddy
in the head almost every morning, and so weary and dull all day
that she had hardly spirit to do anything but read
story-books.&nbsp; And Mrs. Lacy was quite poorly too, though not
saying much about it; was never quite without a head-ache, and
was several times obliged to send Kate out for her evening walk
with Josephine.</p>
<p>It was high time to be going out of town; and Mrs. Lacy was to
go and be with her son in his vacation.</p>
<p>This was the time when Kate and the Wardours had hoped to be
together.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the natural consequence&rdquo; of the
nonsense Kate had talked, about being &ldquo;always
allowed&rdquo; to do rude and careless things, and her wild
rhodomontade about romping games with the boys, had persuaded her
aunts that they were very improper people for her to be with, and
that it would be wrong to consent to her going to Oldburgh.</p>
<p>That was one natural consequence of her folly.&nbsp; Another
was that when the De la Poers begged that she might spend the
holidays with them, and from father and mother downwards were
full of kind schemes for her happiness and good, Lady Barbara
said to her sister that it was quite impossible; these good
friends did not know what they were asking, and that the child
would again expose herself in some way that would never be
forgotten, unless she were kept in their own sight till she had
been properly tamed and reduced to order.</p>
<p>It was self-denying in Lady Barbara to refuse that invitation,
for she and her sister would have been infinitely more
comfortable together without their troublesome
countess&mdash;above all when they had no governess to relieve
them of her.&nbsp; The going out of town was sad enough to them,
for they had always paid a long visit at Caergwent Castle, which
had felt like their home through the lifetime of their brother
and nephew; but now it was shut up, and their grief for their
young nephew came back all the more freshly at the time of year
when they were used to be kindly entertained by him in their
native home.</p>
<p>But as they could not go there, they went to Bournemouth and
the first run Kate took upon the sands took away all the
giddiness from her head, and put an end to the tired feeling in
her limbs!&nbsp; It really was a run!&nbsp; Aunt Barbara gave her
leave to go out with Josephine; and though Josephine said it was
very sombre and savage, between the pine-woods and the sea, Kate
had not felt her heart leap with such fulness of enjoyment since
she had made snow-balls last winter at home.&nbsp; She ran down
to the waves, and watched them sweep in and curl over and break,
as if she could never have enough of them; and she gazed at the
grey outline of the Isle of Wight opposite, feeling as if there
was something very great in really seeing an island.</p>
<p>When she came in, there was so much glow on her brown check,
and her eyelids looked so much less heavy, that both the aunts
gazed at her with pleasure, smiled to one another, and Lady Jane
kissed her, while Lady Barbara said, &ldquo;This was the right
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to be out as much as possible, so her aunt made a set
of new rules for the day.&nbsp; There was to be a walk before
breakfast; then breakfast; then Lady Barbara heard her read her
chapter in the Bible, and go through her music.&nbsp; And really
the music was not half as bad as might have been expected with
Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; Kate was too much afraid of her to give the
half attention she had paid to poor Mrs. Lacy&mdash;fright and
her aunt&rsquo;s decision of manner forced her to mind what she
was about; and though Aunt Barbara found her really very dull and
unmusical, she did get on better than before, and learnt
something, though more like a machine than a musician.</p>
<p>Then she went out again till the hottest part of the day,
during which a bit of French and of English reading was expected
from her, and half an hour of needle-work; then her dinner; and
then out again&mdash;with her aunts this time, Aunt Jane in a
wheeled-chair, and Aunt Barbara walking with her&mdash;this was
rather dreary; but when they went in she was allowed to stay out
with Josephine, with only one interval in the house for tea, till
it grew dark, and she was so sleepy with the salt wind, that she
was ready for bed, and had no time to think of the Lord
Chancellor.</p>
<p>At first, watching those wonderful and beautiful waves was
pleasure enough; and then she was allowed, to her wonder and
delight, to have a holland dress, and dig in the sand, making
castles and moats, or rocks and shipwrecks, with beautiful
stories about them; and sometimes she hunted for the few shells
and sea-weeds there, or she sat down and read some of her
favourite books, especially poetry&mdash;it suited the sea so
well; and she was trying to make Ellen&rsquo;s Isle and all the
places of the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo; in sand, only she
never had time to finish them, and they always were either thrown
down or washed away before she could return to them.</p>
<p>But among all these amusements, she was watching the families
of children who played together, happy creatures!&nbsp; The
little sturdy boys, that dabbled about so merrily, and minded so
little the &ldquo;Now Masters&rdquo; of their indignant nurses;
the little girls in brown hats, with their baskets full; the big
boys, that even took off shoes, and dabbled in the shallow water;
the great sieges of large castles, where whole parties attacked
and defended&mdash;it was a sort of melancholy glimpse of
fairy-land to her, for she had only been allowed to walk on the
beach with Josephine on condition she never spoke to the other
children.</p>
<p>Would the Lord Chancellor be after her if she did?&nbsp; Her
heart quite yearned for those games, or even to be able to talk
to one of those little damsels; and one day when a bright-faced
girl ran after her with a piece of weed that she had dropped, she
could hardly say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for her longing to say
more; and many were the harangues she composed within herself to
warn the others not to wish to change places with her, for to be
a countess was very poor fun indeed.</p>
<p>However, one morning at the end of the first week, Kate looked
up from a letter from Sylvia, and said with great glee,
&ldquo;Aunt Barbara!&nbsp; O Aunt Barbara!&nbsp; Alice and the
other Sylvia&mdash;Sylvia Joanna&mdash;are coming!&nbsp; I may
play with them, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; said her aunt gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Wardour&rsquo;s nieces,&rdquo; said Kate;
&ldquo;Sylvia&rsquo;s cousins, you know, only we never saw them;
but they are just my age; and it will be such fun&mdash;only
Alice is ill, I believe.&nbsp; Pray&mdash;please&mdash;let me
play with them!&rdquo; and Kate had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see about it when they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t have them
there&mdash;Sylvia&rsquo;s own, own cousins&mdash;and not play
with them!&nbsp; Please, Aunt Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know that this impetuosity never disposes
me favourably, Katharine; I will inquire and consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had learnt wisdom enough not to say any more just then;
but the thought of sociability, the notion of chattering freely
to young companions, and of a real game at play, and the terror
of having all this withheld, and of being thought too proud and
haughty for the Wardours, put her into such an agony, that she
did not know what she was about, made mistakes even in reading,
and blundered her music more than she had over done under Lady
Barbara&rsquo;s teaching; and then, when her aunt reproved her,
she could not help laying down her head and bursting into a fit
of crying.&nbsp; However, she had not forgotten the terrible
tea-drinking, and was resolved not to be as bad as at that time,
and she tried to stop herself, exclaiming between her sobs,
&ldquo;O Aunt
Bar&mdash;bar&mdash;a,&mdash;I&mdash;can&mdash;not&mdash;help
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lady Barbara did not scold or look
stern.&nbsp; Perhaps she saw that the little girl was really
trying to chock herself, for she said quite kindly,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then, to Kate&rsquo;s great wonder, in came Lady
Jane, though it was full half an hour earlier than she usually
left her room; and Lady Barbara looked up to her, and said, quite
as if excusing herself, &ldquo;Indeed, Jane, I have not been
angry with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kate, somehow, understanding that she might, flung herself
down by Aunt Jane, and hid her face in her lap, not crying any
more, though the sobs were not over, and feeling the fondling
hands on her hair very tender and comforting, though she wondered
to hear them talk as if she were asleep or deaf&mdash;or perhaps
they thought their voices too low, or their words too long and
fine for her to understand; nor perhaps did she, though she
gathered their drift well enough, and that kind Aunt Jane was
quite pleading for herself in having come to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not help it, indeed&mdash;you remember Lady de
la Poer, Dr. Woodman, both&mdash;excitable, nervous
temperament&mdash;almost hysterical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This unfortunate intelligence&mdash;untoward
coincidence&mdash;&rdquo; said Lady Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
have been trying to make her feel I am not in anger, and I hope
there really was a struggle for self-control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate took her head up again at this, a little encouraged; and
Lady Jane kissed her forehead, and repeated, &ldquo;Aunt Barbara
was not angry with you, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for I think you have tried to conquer
yourself,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara.&nbsp; She did not think it
wise to tell Kate that she thought she could not help it, though
oddly enough, the very thing had just been said over the
child&rsquo;s head, and Kate ventured on it to get up, and say
quietly, &ldquo;Yes, it was not Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s speaking to
me that made me cry, but I am so unhappy about Alice and Sylvia
Joanna;&rdquo; and a soft caress from Aunt Jane made her venture
to go on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not only the playing with them,
though I do wish for that very very much indeed; but it would be
so unkind, and so proud and ungrateful, to despise my own
cousin&rsquo;s cousins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more like the speeches Kate made in her own head than
anything she had ever said to her aunts; and it was quite just
besides, and not spoken in naughtiness, and Lady Barbara did not
think it wrong to show that she attended to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are right, Katharine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no one wishes you
to be either proud or ungrateful.&nbsp; I would not wish entirely
to prevent you from seeing the children of the family, but it
must not be till there is some acquaintance between myself and
their mother, and I cannot tell whether you can be intimate with
them till I know what sort of children they are.&nbsp; Much, too,
must depend on yourself, and whether you will behave well with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate gave a long sigh, and looked up relieved; and for some
time she and her aunt were not nearly so much at war as hitherto,
but seemed to be coming to a somewhat better understanding.</p>
<p>Yet it rather puzzled Kate.&nbsp; She seemed to herself to
have got this favour for crying for it; and it was a belief at
home, not only that nothing was got by crying, but that if by
some strange chance it were, it never came to good; and she began
the more to fear some disappointment about the expected
Wardours.</p>
<p>For two or three days she was scanning every group on the
sands with all her might, in hopes of some likeness to Sylvia,
but at last she was taken by surprise: just as she was dressed,
and Aunt Barbara was waiting in the drawing-room for Aunt Jane,
there came a knock at the door, and &ldquo;Mrs. Wardour&rdquo;
was announced.</p>
<p>In came a small, quiet-looking lady in mourning, and with her
a girl of about Kate&rsquo;s own age; there was some curtseying
and greeting between the two ladies, and her aunt said,
&ldquo;Here is my niece.&mdash;Come and speak to Mrs. Wardour, my
dear,&rdquo; and motioned her forwards.</p>
<p>Now to be motioned forwards by Aunt Barbara always made Kate
shrink back into herself, and the presence of a little girl
before elders likewise rendered her shy and bashful, so she came
forth as if intensely disgusted, put out her hand as if she were
going to poke, and muttered her favourite &ldquo;&mdash;do&rdquo;
so awkwardly and coldly, that Lady Barbara felt how proud and
ungracious it looked, and to make up said, &ldquo;My niece has
been very eager for your coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the two
little girls drew off into the window, and looked at each other
under their eyelashes in silence.</p>
<p>Sylvia Joanna Wardour was not like her namesake at home,
Sylvia Katharine.&nbsp; She was a thin, slight, quiet-looking
child, with so little to note about her face, that Kate was soon
wondering at her dress being so much smarter than her own was at
present.&nbsp; She herself had on a holland suit with a deep
cape, which, except that they were adorned with labyrinths of
white braid, were much what she had worn at home, also a round
brown hat, shading her face from the sun; whereas Sylvia&rsquo;s
face was exposed by a little turban hat so deeply edged with blue
velvet, that the white straw was hardly seen; had a little
watered-silk jacket, and a little flounced frock of a dark silk
figured with blue, that looked slightly fuzzed out; and perhaps
she was not at ease in this fine dress, for she stood with her
head down, and one hand on the window-sill, pretending to look
out of window, but really looking at Kate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two grown-up ladies were almost as stiff and
shy, though they could not keep dead silence like the
children.&nbsp; Mrs. Wardour had heard before that Lady Barbara
Umfraville was a formidable person, and was very much afraid of
her; and Lady Barbara was not a person to set anyone at ease.</p>
<p>So there was a little said about taking the liberty of
calling, for her brother-in-law was so anxious to hear of Lady
Caergwent: and Lady Barbara said her niece was very well and
healthy, and had only needed change of air.</p>
<p>And then came something in return about Mrs. Wardour&rsquo;s
other little girl, a sad invalid, she said, on whose account they
were come to Bournemouth; and there was a little more said of
bathing, and walking, and whether the place was full; and then
Mrs. Wardour jumped up and said she was detaining Lady Barbara,
and took leave; Kate, though she had not spoken a word to Sylvia
Wardour, looking at her wistfully with all her eyes, and feeling
more than usually silly.</p>
<p>And when the guests were gone her aunt told her how foolish
her want of manner was, and how she had taken the very means to
make them think she was not glad to see them.&nbsp; She hung down
her head, and pinched the ends of her gloves; she knew it very
well, but that did not make it a bit more possible to find a word
to say to a stranger before the elders, unless the beginning were
made for her as by the De la Poers.</p>
<p>However, she knew it would be very different out of doors, and
her heart bounded when her aunt added, &ldquo;They seem to be
quiet, lady-like, inoffensive people, and I have no objection to
your associating with the little girl in your walks, as long as I
do not see that it makes you thoughtless and
ungovernable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you, Aunt Barbara!&rdquo; cried
Kate, with a bouncing bound that did not promise much for her
thought or her governableness; but perhaps Lady Barbara
recollected what her own childhood would have been without Jane,
for she was not much discomposed, only she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very odd you should be so uncivil to the child in
her presence, and so ecstatic now!&nbsp; However, take care you
do not get too familiar.&nbsp; Remember, these Wardours are no
relations, and I will not have you letting them call you by your
Christian name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s bright looks sank.&nbsp; That old married-woman
sound, Lady Caergwent, seemed as if it would be a bar between her
and the free childish fun she hoped for.&nbsp; Yet when so much
had been granted, she must not call her aunt cross and unkind,
though she did think it hard and proud.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was partly right; but after all, little people
cannot judge what is right in matters of familiarity.&nbsp; They
have only to do as they are told, and they may be sure of this,
that friendship and respect depend much more on what people are
in themselves than on what they call one another.</p>
<p>This lady was the widow of Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s brother, and
lived among a great clan of his family in a distant county, where
Mary and her father had sometimes made visits, but the younger
ones never.&nbsp; Kate was not likely to have been asked there,
for it was thought very hard that she should be left on the hands
of her aunt&rsquo;s husband: and much had been said of the duty
of making her grand relations provide for her, or of putting her
into the &ldquo;Clergy Orphan Asylum.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there had
been much displeasure when Mr. Wardour answered that he did not
think it right that a child who had friends should live on the
charity intended for those who had none able to help them; and
soon after the decision he had placed his son Armyn in Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s office, instead of sending him to the
University.&nbsp; All the Wardours were much vexed then; but they
were not much better pleased when the little orphan had come to
her preferment, and he made no attempt to keep her in his hands,
and obtain the large sum allowed for her board&mdash;only saying
that his motherless household was no place for her, and that he
could not at once do his duty by her and by his parish.&nbsp;
They could not understand the real love and uprightness that made
him prefer her advantage to his own&mdash;what was right to what
was convenient.</p>
<p>Mrs. George Wardour had not scolded her brother-in-law for his
want of prudence and care for his own children&rsquo;s interests;
but she had agreed with those who did; and this, perhaps, made
her feel all the more awkward and shy when she was told that she
<i>must</i> go and call upon the Lady Umfravilles, whom the whole
family regarded as first so neglectful and then so ungrateful,
and make acquaintance with the little girl who had once been held
so cheap.&nbsp; She was a kind, gentle person, and a careful,
anxious mother, but not wishing to make great acquaintance, nor
used to fine people, large or small, and above all, wrapped up in
her poor little delicate Alice.</p>
<p>The next time Kate saw her she was walking by the side of
Alice&rsquo;s wheeled-chair, and Sylvia by her side, in a more
plain and suitable dress.&nbsp; Kate set off running to greet
them; but at a few paces from them was seized by a shy fit, and
stood looking and feeling like a goose, drawing great C&rsquo;s
with the point of her parasol in the sand; Josephine looking on,
and thinking how &ldquo;<i>b&ecirc;te</i>&rdquo; English children
were.&nbsp; Mrs. Wardour was not much less shy; but she knew she
must make a beginning, and so spoke in the middle of Kate&rsquo;s
second C: and there was a shaking of hands, and walking
together.</p>
<p>They did not get on very well: nobody talked but Mrs. Wardour,
and she asked little frightened questions about the Oldburgh
party, as she called them, which Kate answered as shortly and
shyly&mdash;the more so from the uncomfortable recollection that
her aunt had told her that this was the very way to seem proud
and unkind; but what could she do?&nbsp; She felt as if she were
frozen up stiff, and could neither move nor look up like
herself.&nbsp; At last Mrs. Wardour said that Alice would be
tired, and must go in; and then Kate managed to blurt out a
request that Sylvia might stay with her.&nbsp; Poor Sylvia looked
a good deal scared, and as if she longed to follow her mamma and
sister; but the door was shut upon her, and she was left alone
with those two strange people&mdash;the Countess and the
Frenchwoman!</p>
<p>However, Kate recovered the use of her limbs and tongue in a
moment, and instantly took her prisoner&rsquo;s hand, and ran off
with her to the corner where the scenery of Loch Katrine had so
often been begun, and began with great animation to
explain.&nbsp; This&mdash;a hole that looked as if an old hen had
been grubbing in it&mdash;was Loch Katrine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loch Katharine&mdash;that&rsquo;s yours!&nbsp; And
which is to be Loch Sylvia?&rdquo; said the child, recovering, as
she began to feel by touch, motion, and voice, that she had only
to do with a little girl after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loch nonsense!&rdquo; said Kate, rather bluntly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you never hear of the Lochs, the Lakes, in
Scotland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loch Lomond, Loch Katrine, Loch Awe, Loch
Ness?&mdash;But I don&rsquo;t do my geography out of
doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t geography; &rsquo;tis the
&lsquo;The Lady of the Lake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a new game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! did you never read &lsquo;The Lady of the
Lake?&rsquo;&mdash;Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s poem&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;The summer
dawn&rsquo;s reflected hue&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learnt that in my extracts; but I
never did my poetry task out of doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t a task&mdash;&rsquo;tis beautiful
poetry!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you like poetry better than
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it better than all my other lessons, when it is
not very long and hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate felt that her last speech would have brought Armyn and
Charlie down on her for affectation, and that it was not strictly
true that she liked poetry better than anything, for a game at
romps, and a very amusing story, were still better things; so she
did not exclaim at the other Sylvia&rsquo;s misunderstanding, but
only said, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Lady of the Lake&rsquo; is story and
poetry too, and we will play at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you as we go on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the
King&mdash;that is, the Knight of Snowdon&mdash;James Fitzjames,
for I&rsquo;m in disguise, you know; and you&rsquo;re
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I be Ellen?&nbsp; We had a horrid nurse once, who
used to slap us, and was called Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was her name.&nbsp; She was Ellen Douglas, and
was in banishment on an island with her father.&nbsp; You are
Ellen, and Josephine is your old harper&mdash;Allan Bane; she
talks French, you know, and that will do for Highland: Gallic and
Gaelic sound alike, you know.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;m
going out hunting, and my dear gallant grey will drop down dead
with fatigue, and I shall lose my way; and when you hear me wind
my horn too-too, you get upon your hoop&mdash;that will be your
boat, you know&mdash;and answer &lsquo;Father!&rsquo; and when I
too-too again, answer &lsquo;Malcolm!&rsquo; and then put up your
hand behind your ear, and stand listening</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With locks thrown back and lips apart,<br
/>
Like monument of Grecian art;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away scudded the delighted Kate; and after having lamented her
gallant grey, and admired the Trosachs, came up too-tooing
through her hand with all her might, but found poor Ellen, very
unlike a monument of Grecian art, absolutely crying, and Allan
Bane using his best English and kindest tones to console her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Miladi l&rsquo;a stup&eacute;faite&mdash;la pauvre
petite</i>!&rdquo; began Josephine; and Kate in consternation
asking what was the matter, and Josephine encouraging her, it was
all sobbed out.&nbsp; She did not like to be called
Ellen&mdash;and she thought it unkind to send her into
banishment&mdash;and she had fancied she was to get astride on
her hoop, which she justly thought highly improper&mdash;and
above all, she could not bear to say
&lsquo;Father&rsquo;&mdash;because&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought you would mind that,&rdquo; said Kate,
rather abashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never did; and I never saw my papa
or mamma either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;so you didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Kate gravely, &ldquo;we
won&rsquo;t play at that.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have
&lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; instead; and I&rsquo;ll be
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like you to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only in play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;please, let us have a nice
play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you call a nice play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice and I used to drive hoops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tiresome!&nbsp; My hoop always tumbles
down: think of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice and I used to play at ball; but there&rsquo;s no
ball here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stuff my pocket-handkerchief with
seaweed, and make one;&rdquo; and Kate spread out her delicate
cambric one&mdash;not quite so fit for such a purpose as the
little cheap cotton ones at home, that Mary tried in vain to save
from cruel misuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a famous piece!&nbsp; Look, it is all
wriggled; it is a mermaid&rsquo;s old stay-lace that she has used
and thrown away.&nbsp; Perhaps she broke it in a passion because
her grandmother made her wear so many oyster-shells on her
tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no such creatures as mermaids,&rdquo; said
Sylvia, looking at her solemnly.</p>
<p>This was not a promising beginning; Sylvia Joanna was not a
bit like Sylvia Katharine, nor like Adelaide and Grace de la
Poer; yet by seeing each other every day, she and Kate began to
shake together, and become friends.</p>
<p>There was no fear of her exciting Kate to run wild; she was a
little pussy-cat in her dread of wet, and guarded her clothes as
if they could feel&mdash;indeed, her happiest moments were spent
in the public walks by Alice&rsquo;s chair, studying how the
people were dressed; but still she thought it a fine thing to be
the only child in Bournemouth who might play with the little
Countess, and was so silly as to think the others envied her when
she was dragged and ordered about, bewildered by Kate&rsquo;s
loud rapid talk about all kinds of odd things in books, and
distressed at being called on to tear through the pine-woods, or
grub in wet sand.&nbsp; But it was not all silly vanity: she was
a gentle, loving little girl, very good-natured, and sure to get
fond of all who were kind to her; and she liked Kate&rsquo;s
bright ways and amusing manner&mdash;perhaps really liking her
more than if she had understood her better; and Kate liked her,
and rushed after her on every occasion, as the one creature with
whom it was possible to play and to chatter.</p>
<p>No, not quite the one; for poor sick Alice was better for talk
and quiet play than her sister.&nbsp; She read a great deal; and
there was an exchange of story-books, and much conversation over
them, between her and Kate&mdash;indeed, the spirit and animation
of this new friend quite made her light up, and brighten out of
her languor whenever the shrill laughing voice came near.&nbsp;
And Kate, after having got over her first awe at coming near a
child so unlike herself, grew very fond of her, and felt how good
and sweet and patient she was.&nbsp; She never ran off to play
till Alice was taken in-doors; and spent all her spare time
in-doors in drawing picture stories, which were daily explained
to the two sisters at some seat in the pine-woods.</p>
<p>There was one very grand one, that lasted all the latter part
of the stay at Bournemouth&mdash;as the evenings grew longer, and
Kate had more time for preparing it, at the rate of four or five
scenes a day, drawn and painted&mdash;being the career of a very
good little girl, whose parents were killed in a railway
accident, (a most fearful picture was that&mdash;all blunders
being filled up by spots of vermilion blood and orange-coloured
flame!) and then came all the wonderful exertions by which she
maintained her brothers and sisters, taught them, and kept them
in order.</p>
<p>They all had names; and there was a naughty little Alexander,
whose monkey tricks made even Sylvia laugh.&nbsp; Sylvia was very
anxious that the admirable heroine, Hilda, should be rewarded by
turning into a countess; and could not enter into Kate&rsquo;s
first objection&mdash;founded on fact&mdash;that it could not be
without killing all the brothers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t
it be done in play, like so many other things?&rdquo;&nbsp; To
which Kate answered, &ldquo;There is a sort of true in
play;&rdquo; but as Sylvia could not understand her, nor she
herself get at her own idea, she went on to her other objection,
a still more startling one&mdash;that &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t
wish Hilda anything so nasty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this very ignoble word was long a puzzle to Alice and
Sylvia.</p>
<p>Thus the time at the sea-side was very happy&mdash;quite the
happiest since Kate&rsquo;s change of fortune.&nbsp; The one flaw
in those times on the sands was when she was alone with Sylvia
and Josephine; not in Sylvia&rsquo;s dulness&mdash;that she had
ceased to care about&mdash;but in a little want of plain
dealing.&nbsp; Sylvia was never wild or rude, but she was not
strictly obedient when out of sight; and when Kate was shocked
would call it very unkind, and caress and beseech her not to
tell.</p>
<p>They were such tiny things, that they would hardly bear
mention; but one will do as a specimen.&nbsp; Sylvia was one of
those very caressing children who can never be happy without
clinging to their friends, kissing them constantly, and always
calling them dear, love, and darling.</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Wardour knew it was not becoming to see all this
embracing in public, and was sure besides that Lady Barbara would
not like to see the Countess hung upon in Sylvia&rsquo;s
favourite way; so she forbade all such demonstrations except the
parting and meeting kiss.&nbsp; It was a terrible grievance to
Sylvia&mdash;it seemed as if her heart could not love without her
touch; but instead of training herself in a little self-control
and obedience, she thought it &ldquo;cross;&rdquo; and Mamma was
no sooner out of sight than her arm was around Kate&rsquo;s
waist.&nbsp; Kate struggled at first&mdash;it did not suit her
honourable conscientiousness; but then Sylvia would begin to cry
at the unkindness, say Kate did not love her, that she would not
be proud if she was a countess: and Kate gave in, liked the
love&mdash;of which, poor child! she got so little&mdash;and let
Sylvia do as she pleased, but never without a sense of
disobedience and dread of being caught.</p>
<p>So, too, about her title.&nbsp; Sylvia called her darling,
duck, and love, and she called Sylvia by plenty of such names;
but she had been obliged to tell of her aunt&rsquo;s
desire&mdash;that Katharine and Kate should never be used.</p>
<p>Sylvia&rsquo;s ready tears fell; but the next day she came
back cheerful, with the great discovery that darling Lady
Caergwent might be called K, her initial, and the first syllable
of her title.&nbsp; It was the cleverest invention Sylvia had
ever made; and she was vexed when Kate demurred, honestly
thinking that her aunts would like it worse than even Kate, and
that therefore she ought not to consent.</p>
<p>But when Sylvia coaxingly uttered, &ldquo;My own dear duck of
a K,&rdquo; and the soft warm arm squeezed her, and the eyes
would have been weeping, and the tongue reproaching in another
moment, she allowed it to go on&mdash;it was so precious and
sweet to be loved; and she told Sylvia she was a star in the dark
night.</p>
<p>No one ever found out those, and one or two other, instances
of small disobedience.&nbsp; They were not mischievous, Josephine
willingly overlooked them, and there was nothing to bring them to
light.&nbsp; It would have been better for Sylvia if her faults
had been of a sort that brought attention on them more
easily!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lady Barbara had almost found in her a model
child&mdash;except for her foolish shy silence before her elders,
before whom she always whispered&mdash;and freely let the girls
be constantly together.&nbsp; The aunt little knew that this meek
well-behaved maiden was giving the first warp to that upright
truth that had been the one sterling point of Kate&rsquo;s
character!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been intended that Mrs. Lacy
should rejoin her pupil at Bournemouth at the end of six weeks;
but in her stead came a letter saying that she was unwell, and
begging for a fortnight&rsquo;s grace.&nbsp; At the
fortnight&rsquo;s end came another letter; to which Lady Barbara
answered that all was going on so well, that there was no need to
think of returning till they should all meet in London on the 1st
of October.</p>
<p>But before that 1st, poor Mrs. Lacy wrote again, with great
regret and many excuses for the inconvenience she was
causing.&nbsp; Her son and her doctor had insisted on her
resigning her situation at once; and they would not even allow
her to go back until her place could be supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; said Lady Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always thought it was too much for her.&nbsp; I wish we could
have made her more comfortable: it would have been such a thing
for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would,&rdquo; answered Lady Barbara, &ldquo;if
she had had to do with any other child.&nbsp; A little
consideration or discretion, such as might have been expected
from a girl of eleven years old towards a person in her
circumstances, would have made her happy, and enabled her to
assist her son.&nbsp; But I have given up expecting feeling from
Katharine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That speech made Kate swell with anger at her aunt&rsquo;s
tone and in her anger she forgot to repent of having been really
thoughtless and almost unkind, or to recollect how differently
her own gentle Sylvia at home would have behaved to the poor
lady.&nbsp; She liked the notion of novelty, and hoped for a new
governess as kind and bright as Miss Oswald.</p>
<p>Moreover, she was delighted to find that Mrs. George Wardour
was going to live in London for the present, that Alice might be
under doctors, and Sylvia under masters.&nbsp; Kate cared little
for the why, but was excessively delighted with plans for
meeting, hopes of walks, talks, and tea-drinkings together;
promises that the other dear Sylvia should come to meet her; and
above all, an invitation to spend Sylvia Joanna&rsquo;s birthday
with her on the 21st of October, and go all together either to
the Zoological Gardens or to the British Museum, according to the
weather.</p>
<p>With these hopes, Kate was only moderately sorry to leave the
sea and pine-trees behind her, and find herself once more
steaming back to London, carrying in her hand a fine blue and
white travelling-bag, worked for her by her two little friends,
but at which Lady Barbara had coughed rather dryly.&nbsp; In the
bag were a great many small white shells done up in twists of
paper, that pretty story &ldquo;The Blue Ribbons,&rdquo; and a
small blank book, in which, whenever the train stopped, Kate
wrote with all her might.&nbsp; For Kate had a desire to convince
Sylvia Joanna that one was much happier without being a countess,
and she thought this could be done very touchingly and poetically
by a fable in verse; so she thought she had a very good idea by
changing the old daisy that pined for transplantation and found
it very unpleasant, into a harebell.</p>
<blockquote><p>A harebell blue on a tuft of moss<br />
In the wind her bells did toss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was her beginning; and the poor harebell was to get into
a hot-house, where they wanted to turn her into a tall stately
campanula, and she went through a great deal from the
gardeners.&nbsp; There was to be a pretty fairy picture to every
verse; and it would make a charming birthday present, much nicer
than anything that could be bought; and Kate kept on smiling to
herself as the drawings came before her mind&rsquo;s eye, and the
rhymes to her mind&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>So they came home; but it was odd, the old temper of the
former months seemed to lay hold of Kate as soon as she set foot
in the house in Bruton Street, as if the cross feelings were
lurking in the old corners.</p>
<p>She began by missing Mrs. Lacy very much.&nbsp; The kind soft
governess had made herself more loved than the wayward child
knew; and when Kate had run into the schoolroom and found nobody
sitting by the fire, no sad sweet smile to greet her, no one to
hear her adventures, and remembered that she had worried the poor
widow, and that she would never come back again, she could have
cried, and really had a great mind to write to her, ask her
pardon, and say she was sorry.&nbsp; It would perhaps have been
the beginning of better things if she had; but of all things in
the world, what prevented her?&nbsp; Just this&mdash;that she had
an idea that her aunt expected it of her!&nbsp; O Kate!&nbsp;
Kate!</p>
<p>So she went back to the harebell, and presently began
rummaging among her books for a picture of one to copy; and just
then Lady Barbara came in, found half a dozen strewn on the
floor, and ordered her to put them tidy, and then be
dressed.&nbsp; That put her out, and after her old bouncing
fashion she flew upstairs, caught her frock in the old hitch at
the turn, and half tore off a flounce.</p>
<p>No wonder Lady Barbara was displeased; and that was the
beginning of things going wrong&mdash;nay, worse than before the
going to Bournemouth.&nbsp; Lady Barbara was seeking for a
governess, but such a lady as she wished for was not to be found
in a day; and in the meantime she was resolved to do her duty by
her niece, and watched over her behaviour, and gave her all the
lessons that she did not have from masters.</p>
<p>Whether it was that Lady Barbara did not know exactly what was
to be expected of a little girl, or whether Kate was more fond of
praise than was good for her, those daily lessons were more
trying than ever they had been.&nbsp; Generally she had liked
them; but with Aunt Barbara, the being told to sit upright, hold
her book straight, or pronounce her words rightly, always teased
her, and put her out of humour at the beginning.&nbsp; Or she was
reminded of some failure of yesterday, and it always seemed to
her unjust that bygones should not be bygones; or even when she
knew she had been doing her best, her aunt always thought she
could have done better, so that she had no heart or spirit to try
another time, but went on in a dull, save-trouble way, hardly
caring to exert herself to avoid a scolding, it was so certain to
come.</p>
<p>It was not right&mdash;a really diligent girl would have won
for herself the peaceful sense of having done her best, and her
aunt would have owned it in time; whereas poor Kate&rsquo;s
resistance only made herself and her aunt worse to each other
every day, and destroyed her sense of duty and obedience more and
more.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara could not be always with her, and when once out
of sight there was a change.&nbsp; If she were doing a lesson
with one of her masters, she fell into a careless attitude in an
instant, and would often chatter so that there was no calling her
to order, except by showing great determination to tell her
aunt.&nbsp; It made her feel both sly and guilty to behave so
differently out of sight, and yet now that she had once begun she
seemed unable to help going on and she was sure, foolish child,
that Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s strictness made her naughty!</p>
<p>Then there were her walks.&nbsp; She was sent out with
Josephine in the morning and desired to walk nowhere but in the
Square; and in the afternoon she and Josephine were usually set
down by the carriage together in one of the parks, and appointed
where to meet it again after Lady Jane had taken her airing when
she was well enough, for she soon became more ailing than
usual.&nbsp; They were to keep in the quiet paths, and not speak
to anyone.</p>
<p>But neither Josephine nor her young lady had any turn for what
was &ldquo;triste.&rdquo;&nbsp; One morning, when Kate was in
great want of a bit of India-rubber, and had been sighing because
of the displeasure she should meet for having lost her own
through using it in play-hours, Josephine offered to take
her&mdash;only a little out of her way&mdash;to buy a new
piece.</p>
<p>Kate knew this was not plain dealing, and hated herself for
it, but she was tired of being scolded, and consented!&nbsp; And
then how miserable she was; how afraid of being asked where she
had been; how terrified lest her aunt should observe that it was
a new, not an old, piece; how humiliated by knowing she was
acting untruth!</p>
<p>And then Josephine took more liberties.&nbsp; When Kate was
walking along the path, thinking how to rhyme to
&ldquo;pride,&rdquo; she saw Josephine talking over the iron rail
to a man with a beard; and she told her maid afterwards that it
was wrong; but Josephine said, &ldquo;Miladi had too good a heart
to betray her,&rdquo; and the man came again and again, and once
even walked home part of the way with Josephine, a little behind
the young lady.</p>
<p>Kate was desperately affronted, and had a great mind to
complain to her aunts.&nbsp; But then Josephine could have told
that they had not been in the Square garden at all that morning,
but in much more entertaining streets!&nbsp; Poor Kate, these
daily disobediences did not weigh on her nearly as much as the
first one did; it was all one general sense of naughtiness!</p>
<p>Working at her harebell was the pleasantest thing she did, but
her eagerness about it often made her neglectful and brought her
into scrapes.&nbsp; She had filled one blank book with her verses
and pictures, some rather good, some very bad; and for want of
help and correction she was greatly delighted with her own
performance, and thought it quite worthy of a little ornamental
album, where she could write out the verses and gum in the
drawings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Aunt Barbara, let me go to the Soho Bazaar
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot take you there, I have an
engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may I not go with Josephine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; I would not trust you there with
her.&nbsp; Besides, you spend too much upon trumpery, as it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it for myself; I want something to
get ready for Sylvia&rsquo;s birthday&mdash;the Sylvia that is
come to London, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not approve of a habit of making
presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but, Aunt Barbara, I am to drink tea with her on
her birthday, and spend the day, and go to the Zoological
Gardens, and I have all ready but my presents! and it will not be
in time if you won&rsquo;t let me go to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never grant anything to pertinacity,&rdquo; answered
Lady Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have told you that I cannot go with
you to-day, and you ought to submit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the birthday, Aunt Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have answered you once, Katharine; you ought to know
better than to persist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate pouted, and the tears swelled in her eyes at the cruelty
of depriving her of the pleasure of making her purchase, and at
having her beautiful fanciful production thus ruined by her
aunt&rsquo;s unkindness.&nbsp; As she sat over her geography
lesson, out of sight of her own bad writing, her broken-backed
illuminated capitals, her lumpy campanulas, crooked-winged
fairies, queer perspective, and dabs of blue paint, she saw her
performance not as it was, but as it was meant to be, heard her
own lines without their awkward rhymes and bits like prose, and
thought of the wonder and admiration of all the Wardour family,
and of the charms of having it secretly lent about as a dear
simple sweet effusion of the talented young countess, who longed
for rural retirement.&nbsp; And down came a great tear into the
red trimming of British North America, and Kate unadvisedly
trying to wipe it up with her handkerchief, made a red smear all
across to Cape Verd!&nbsp; Formerly she would have exclaimed at
once; now she only held up the other side of the book that her
aunt might not see, and felt very shabby all the time.&nbsp; But
Lady Barbara was reading over a letter, and did not look.&nbsp;
If Kate had not been wrapt up in herself, she would have seen
that anxious distressed face.</p>
<p>There came a knock to the schoolroom door.&nbsp; It was Mr.
Mercer, the doctor, who always came to see Lady Jane twice a
week, and startled and alarmed, Lady Barbara sprang up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you want me, Mr. Mercer?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said the doctor, coming in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was only that I promised I would look at this little
lady, just to satisfy Lady Jane, who does not think her quite
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s love of being important always made her ready to
be looked at by Mr. Mercer, who was a kind, fatherly old
gentleman, not greatly apt to give physic, very good-natured, and
from his long attendance more intimate with the two sisters than
perhaps any other person was.&nbsp; Lady Barbara gave an odd sort
of smile, and said, &ldquo;Oh! very well!&rdquo; and the old
gentleman laughed as the two bright clear eyes met his, and said,
&ldquo;No great weight there, I think!&nbsp; Only a geography
fever, eh?&nbsp; Any more giddy heads lately, eh?&nbsp; Or only
when you make cheeses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make cheeses now, my frocks are so
short,&rdquo; said Kate, whose spirits always recovered with the
least change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I went to Bournemouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as Kate, who had a
certain queer pleasure in the operation, put out the long pinky
member with its ruddier tip, quivering like an animal, he laughed
again, and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Lady Caergwent; it is a
satisfaction once in a way to see something perfectly
healthy!&nbsp; You would not particularly wish for a spoonful of
cod-liver oil, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate laughed, made a face, and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor as he released her,
&ldquo;I may set Lady Jane&rsquo;s mind at rest.&nbsp; Nothing
the matter there with the health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter but perverseness, I am
afraid,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, as Kate stole back to her
place, and shut her face in with the board of her atlas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is my sister who is the victim, and I cannot have it go
on.&nbsp; She is so dreadfully distressed whenever the child is
in disgrace that it is doing her serious injury.&nbsp; Do you not
see it, Mr. Mercer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very fond of the child,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mercer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very thing!&nbsp; She is constantly
worrying herself about her, takes all her naughtiness for
illness, and then cannot bear to see her reproved.&nbsp; I assure
you I am forced for my sister&rsquo;s sake to overlook many
things which I know I ought not to pass by.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Kate
shuddered.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But the very anxiety about her is doing
great harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Lady Jane nervous and excited this
morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Mercer: &ldquo;but that seemed to me to
be chiefly about the Colonel&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, &ldquo;of course in some
ways it will be a great pleasure; but it is very unlucky, after
staying till the war was over, that he has had to sell out
without getting his promotion.&nbsp; It will make a great
difference!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of his son&rsquo;s health, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course everything must give way to that, but it
is most unfortunate.&nbsp; The boy has never recovered from his
wound at Lucknow, and they could not bear to part, or they ought
to have sent him home with his mother long ago; and now my
brother has remained at his post till he thought he could be
spared; but he has not got his promotion, which he must have had
in a few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you expect him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were to set off in a fortnight from the time he
wrote, but it all depended on how Giles might be.&nbsp; I wish we
knew; I wish there could be any certainty, this is so bad for my
sister.&nbsp; And just at this very time, without a governess,
when some children would be especially thoughtful and
considerate, that we should have this strange fit of idleness and
perverseness!&nbsp; It is very trying; I feel quite hopeless
sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some children, as Lady Barbara said, would have been rendered
thoughtful and considerate by hearing such a conversation as
this, and have tried to make themselves as little troublesome to
their elders as possible; but there are others who, unless they
are directly addressed, only take in, in a strange dreamy way,
that which belongs to the grown-up world, though quick enough to
catch what concerns themselves.&nbsp; Thus Kate, though aware
that Aunt Barbara thought her naughtiness made Aunt Jane ill, and
that there was a fresh threat of the Lord Chancellor upon the
return of her great-uncle from India, did not in the least
perceive that her Aunt Barbara was greatly perplexed and
harassed, divided between her care for her sister and for her
niece, grieved for her brother&rsquo;s anxiety, and disappointed
that he had been obliged to leave the army, instead of being made
a General.&nbsp; The upshot of all that she carried away with her
was, that it was very cross of Aunt Barbara to think she made
Aunt Jane ill, and very very hard that she could not go to the
bazaar.</p>
<p>Lady Jane did not go out that afternoon, and Lady Barbara set
her niece and Josephine down in the Park, saying that she was
going into Belgravia, and desiring them to meet her near Apsley
House.&nbsp; They began to walk, and Kate began to lament.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If she could only have gone to the bazaar for her
album!&nbsp; It was very hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; Josephine said, &ldquo;why should they not
go?&nbsp; There was plenty of time.&nbsp; Miladi Barbe had given
them till four.&nbsp; She would take la petite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate hung back.&nbsp; She knew it was wrong.&nbsp; She should
never dare produce the book if she had it.</p>
<p>But Josephine did not attend to the faltered English words, or
disposed of them with a &ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; Miladi will guess
nothing!&rdquo; and she had turned decidedly out of the Park, and
was making a sign to a cab.&nbsp; Kate was greatly frightened,
but was more afraid of checking Josephine in the open street, and
making her dismiss the cab, than of getting into it.&nbsp;
Besides, there was a very strong desire in her for the red and
gold square book that had imprinted itself on her
imagination.&nbsp; She could not but be glad to do something in
spite of Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; So they were shut in, and went off
along Piccadilly, Kate&rsquo;s feelings in a strange whirl of
fright and triumph, amid the clattering of the glasses.&nbsp;
Just suppose she saw anyone she knew!</p>
<p>But they got to Soho Square at last; and through the glass
door, in among the stalls&mdash;that fairy land in general to
Kate; but now she was too much frightened and bewildered to do
more than hurry along the passages, staring so wildly for her
albums, that Josephine touched her, and said, &ldquo;Tenez,
Miladi, they will think you farouche.&nbsp; Ah! see the beautiful
wreaths!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Josephine,&rdquo; said Kate impatiently.</p>
<p>But it was not so easy to get the French maid on.&nbsp; A
bazaar was felicity to her, and she had her little lady in her
power; she stood and gazed, admired, and criticised, at every
stall that afforded ornamental wearing apparel or work patterns;
and Kate, making little excursions, and coming back again to her
side, could not get her on three yards in a quarter of an hour,
and was too shy and afraid of being lost, to wander away and
transact her own business.&nbsp; At last they did come to a
counter with ornamental stationery; and after looking at four or
five books, Kate bought a purple embossed one, not at all what
she had had in her mind&rsquo;s eye, just because she was in too
great a fright to look further; and then step by step, very
nearly crying at last, so as to alarm Josephine lest she should
really cry, she got her out at last.&nbsp; It was a quarter to
four, and Josephine was in vain sure that Miladi Barbe would
never be at the place in time; Kate&rsquo;s heart was sick with
fright at the thought of the shame of detection.</p>
<p>She begged to get out at the Marble Arch, and not risk driving
along Park Lane; but Josephine was triumphant in her certainty
that there was time; and on they went, Kate fancying every bay
nose that passed the window would turn out to have the brougham,
the man-servant, and Aunt Barbara behind it.</p>
<p>At length they were set down at what the Frenchwoman thought a
safe distance, and paying the cabman, set out along the side
path, Josephine admonishing her lady that it was best not to walk
so swiftly, or to look guilty, or they would be
&ldquo;<i>trahies</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then Kate really saw the carriage drawn up where
there was an opening in the railings, and the servant holding
open the door for them.&nbsp; Had they been seen?&nbsp; There was
no knowing!&nbsp; Lady Barbara did not say one single word; but
that need not have been surprising&mdash;only how very straight
her back was, how fixed her marble mouth and chin!&nbsp; It was
more like Diana&rsquo;s head than ever&mdash;Diana when she was
shooting all Niobe&rsquo;s daughters, thought Kate, in her
dreamy, vague alarm.&nbsp; Then she looked at Josephine on the
back seat, to see what she thought of it; but the brown sallow
face in the little bonnet was quite still and like
itself&mdash;beyond Kate&rsquo;s power to read.</p>
<p>The stillness, doubt, and suspense, were almost
unbearable.&nbsp; She longed to speak, but had no courage, and
could almost have screamed with desire to have it over, end as it
would.&nbsp; Yet at last, when the carriage did turn into Bruton
Street, fright and shame had so entirely the upper hand, that she
read the numbers on every door, wishing the carriage would only
stand still at each, or go slower, that she might put off the
moment of knowing whether she was found out.</p>
<p>They stopped; the few seconds of ringing, of opening the
doors, of getting out, were over.&nbsp; She knew how it would be,
when, instead of going upstairs, her aunt opened the schoolroom
door, beckoned her in, and said gravely, &ldquo;Lady Caergwent,
while you are under my charge, it is my duty to make you obey
me.&nbsp; Tell me where you have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the sternness of that low lady-like
voice, and of that dark deep eye, that terrified Kate more than
the brightest flash of lightning: and it was well for her that
the habit of truth was too much fixed for falsehood or shuffling
even to occur to her.&nbsp; She did not dare to do more than
utter in a faint voice, scarcely audible &ldquo;To the
bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In direct defiance of my commands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sound of her own confession, the relief of having
told, gave Kate spirit to speak; &ldquo;I know it was
naughty,&rdquo; she said, looking up; &ldquo;I ought not.&nbsp;
Aunt Barbara, I have been very naughty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
often where you didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the whole truth, Katharine;&rdquo; and Lady
Barbara&rsquo;s look relaxed, and the infinite relief of putting
an end to a miserable concealment was felt by the little girl; so
she told of the shops she had been at, and of her walks in
frequented streets, adding that indeed she would not have gone,
but that Josephine took her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did like it,&rdquo;
she added candidly; &ldquo;but I know I ought not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Katharine,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, almost as
sternly as ever; &ldquo;I had thought that with all your faults
you were to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you the truth!&rdquo; cried Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you may have; but you have been deceiving me all
this time; you, who ought to set an example of upright and
honourable conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Aunt!&rdquo; exclaimed Kate, her eyes
flashing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never spoke one untrue word to you; and
I have not now&mdash;nor ever.&nbsp; I never deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say that you have <i>told</i> untruths.&nbsp;
It is deceiving to betray the confidence placed in
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate knew it was; yet she had never so felt that her aunt
trusted her as to have the sense of being on honour; and she felt
terribly wounded and grieved, but not so touched as to make her
cry or ask pardon.&nbsp; She knew she had been audaciously
disobedient; but it was hard to be accused of betraying trust
when she had never felt that it was placed in her; and yet the
conviction of deceit took from her the last ground she had of
peace with herself.</p>
<p>Drooping and angry, she stood without a word; and her aunt
presently said, &ldquo;I do not punish you.&nbsp; The
consequences of your actions are punishment enough in themselves,
and I hope they may warn you, or I cannot tell what is to become
of you in your future life, and of all that will depend on
you.&nbsp; You must soon be under more strict and watchful care
than mine, and I hope the effect may be good.&nbsp; Meantime, I
desire that your Aunt Jane may be spared hearing of this affair,
little as you seem to care for her peace of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went Lady Barbara; while Kate, flinging herself upon
the sofa, sobbed out, &ldquo;I do care for Aunt Jane!&nbsp; I
love Aunt Jane!&nbsp; I love her ten hundred times more than you!
you horrid cross old Diana!&nbsp; But I have deceived!&nbsp; Oh,
I am getting to be a wicked little girl!&nbsp; I never did such
things at home.&nbsp; Nobody made me naughty there.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s the fashionable world.&nbsp; It is corrupting my
simplicity.&nbsp; It always does.&nbsp; And I shall be
lost!&nbsp; O Mary, Mary!&nbsp; O Papa, Papa!&nbsp; Oh, come and
take me home!&rdquo;&nbsp; And for a little while Kate gasped out
these calls, as if she had really thought they would break the
spell, and bring her back to Oldburgh.</p>
<p>She ceased crying at last, and slowly crept upstairs, glad to
meet no one, and that not even Josephine was there to see her red
eyes.&nbsp; Her muslin frock was on the bed, and she managed to
dress herself, and run down again unseen; she stood over the
fire, so that the housemaid, who brought in her tea, should not
see her face; and by the time she had to go to the drawing-room,
the mottling of her face had abated under the influence of a
story-book, which always drove troubles away for the time.</p>
<p>It was a very quiet evening.&nbsp; Aunt Barbara read bits out
of the newspaper, and there was a little talk over them: and Kate
read on in her book, to hinder herself from feeling
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Now and then Aunt Jane said a few soft words
about &ldquo;Giles and Emily;&rdquo; but her sister always led
away from the subject, afraid of her exciting herself, and
getting anxious.</p>
<p>And if Kate had been observing, she would have heard in the
weary sound of Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s voice, and seen in those
heavy eyelids, that the troubles of the day had brought on a
severe headache, and that there was at least one person suffering
more than even the young ill-used countess.</p>
<p>And when bed-time came, she learnt more of the
&ldquo;consequences of her actions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stiff Mrs.
Bartley stood there with her candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Josephine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone away, my Lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate asked no more, but shivered and trembled all over.&nbsp;
She recollected that in telling the truth she had justified
herself, and at Josephine&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; She knew
Josephine would call it a blackness&mdash;a treason.&nbsp; What
would become of the poor bright merry Frenchwoman?&nbsp; Should
she never see her again?&nbsp; And all because she had not had
the firmness to be obedient!&nbsp; Oh, loss of trust! loss of
confidence! disobedience!&nbsp; How wicked this place made her!
and would there be any end to it?</p>
<p>And all night she was haunted through her dreams with the Lord
Chancellor, in his wig, trying to catch her, and stuff her into
the woolsack, and Uncle Wardour&rsquo;s voice always just out of
reach.&nbsp; If she could only get to him!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young countess was not easily
broken down.&nbsp; If she was ever so miserable for one hour, she
was ready to be amused the next; and though when left to herself
she felt very desolate in the present, and much afraid of the
future, the least enlivenment brightened her up again into more
than her usual spirits.&nbsp; Even an entertaining bit in the
history that she was reading would give her so much amusement
that she would forget her disgrace in making remarks and asking
questions, till Lady Barbara gravely bade her not waste time, and
decided that she had no feeling.</p>
<p>It was not more easy to find a maid than a governess to Lady
Barbara&rsquo;s mind, nor did she exert herself much in the
matter, for, as Kate heard her tell Mr. Mercer, she had decided
that the present arrangement could not last; and then something
was asked about the Colonel and Mrs. Umfraville; to which the
answer was, &ldquo;Oh no, quite impossible; she could never be in
a house with an invalid;&rdquo; and then ensued something about
the Chancellor and an establishment, which, as usual, terrified
Kate&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>Indeed that night terrors were at their height, for Mrs.
Bartley never allowed dawdling, and with a severely respectful
silence made the undressing as brief an affair as possible,
brushing her hair till her head tingled all over, putting away
the clothes with the utmost speed, and carrying off the candle as
soon as she had uttered her grim &ldquo;Good-night, my
Lady,&rdquo; leaving Kate to choose between her pet
terrors&mdash;either of the Lord Chancellor, or of the house on
fire&mdash;or a very fine new one, that someone would make away
with her to make way for her Uncle Giles and his son to come to
her title.&nbsp; Somehow Lady Barbara had contrived to make her
exceedingly in awe of her Uncle Giles, the strict stern soldier
who was always implicitly obeyed, and who would be so shocked at
her.&nbsp; She wished she could hide somewhere when he was
coming!&nbsp; But there was one real good bright pleasure near,
that would come before her misfortunes; and that was the birthday
to be spent at the Wardours&rsquo;.&nbsp; As to the present,
Josephine had had the album in her pocket, and had never restored
it, and Kate had begun to feel a distaste to the whole
performance, to recollect its faults, and to be ashamed of the
entire affair; but that was no reason she should not be very
happy with her friends, who had promised to take her to the
Zoological Gardens.</p>
<p>She had not seen them since her return to London; they were at
Westbourne Road, too far off for her to walk thither even if she
had had anyone to go with her, and though they had called, no one
had seen them; but she had had two or three notes, and had sent
some &ldquo;story pictures&rdquo; by the post.&nbsp; And the
thoughts of that day of freedom and enjoyment of talking to
Alice, being petted by Mrs. Wardour and caressed by Sylvia,
seemed to bear her through all the dull morning walks, in which
she was not only attended by Bartley, but by the man-servant; all
the lessons with her aunt, and the still more dreary exercise
which Lady Barbara took with her in some of the parks in the
afternoon.&nbsp; She counted the days to the 21st whenever she
woke in the morning; and at last Saturday was come, and it would
be Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katharine,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara at breakfast,
&ldquo;you had better finish your drawing to-day; here is a note
from Madame to say it will suit her best to come on Monday
instead of Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but, Aunt Barbara, I am going to Westbourne Road on
Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; I was not aware of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is Sylvia&rsquo;s birthday! and I am going to
the Zoological Gardens with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray how came you to make this engagement without
consulting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all settled at Bournemouth.&nbsp; I thought you
knew!&nbsp; Did not Mrs. Wardour ask your leave for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wardour said something about hoping to see you in
London, but I made no decided answer.&nbsp; I should not have
allowed the intimacy there if I had expected that the family
would be living in London; and there is no reason that it should
continue.&nbsp; Constant intercourse would not be at all
desirable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may I not go on Monday?&rdquo; said Kate, her eyes
opening wide with consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not.&nbsp; You have not deserved that I
should trust you; I do not know whom you might meet there: and I
cannot have you going about with any chance person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Aunt Barbara!&nbsp; Aunt Barbara!&nbsp; I have
promised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your promise can be of no effect without my
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will expect me.&nbsp; They will be so
disappointed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help that.&nbsp; They ought to have applied to
me for my consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Kate hopefully, &ldquo;Mrs.
Wardour will write to-day.&nbsp; If she does, will you let me
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Katharine.&nbsp; While you are under my charge, I
am accountable for you, and I will not send you into society I
know nothing about.&nbsp; Let me hear no more of this, but write
a note excusing yourself, and we will let the coachman take it to
the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was thoroughly enraged, and forgot even her fears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t excuse myself,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I shall say you will not let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will write a proper and gentlewoman-like
note,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara quietly, &ldquo;so as not to give
needless offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall say,&rdquo; exclaimed Kate more loudly,
&ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t go because you won&rsquo;t let me go
near old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the schoolroom, and write a proper note,
Katharine; I shall come presently, and see what you have
said,&rdquo; repeated Lady Barbara, commanding her own temper
with some difficulty.</p>
<p>Kate flung away into the schoolroom, muttering, and in a
tumult of exceeding disappointment, anger, and despair, too
furious even to cry, and dashing about the room, calling Aunt
Barbara after every horrible heroine she could think of, and
pitying herself and her friends, till the thought of
Sylvia&rsquo;s disappointment stung her beyond all bearing.&nbsp;
She was still rushing hither and thither, inflaming her passion,
when her aunt opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the note?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down then this instant, and write,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara, with her Diana face and cool way, the most terrible of
all.</p>
<p>Kate sulkily obeyed, but as she seated herself, muttered,
&ldquo;I shall say you won&rsquo;t let me go near
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write as I tell you.&mdash;My dear Mrs.
Wardour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you may be expecting to see me on
Monday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear; I know she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write&mdash;I fear you may be expecting me on Monday,
as something passed on the subject at Bournemouth; and in order
to prevent inconvenience, I write to say that it will not be in
my power to call on that day, as my aunt had made a previous
engagement for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; cried
Kate, breaking out of all bounds in her indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recollect yourself, Lady Caergwent,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true!&rdquo; cried Kate passionately, jumping
up from her seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had not made an engagement for
me!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t write it!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t write lies,
and you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not allow such words or such a manner in speaking
to me,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, not in the least above her usual
low voice; and her calmness made Kate the more furious, and jump
and dance round with passion, repeating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
write lies, nor tell lies, for you or anyone; you may kill me,
but I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is enough exposure of yourself, Lady
Caergwent,&rdquo; said her aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you have come
to your senses, and choose to apologize for insulting me, and
show me the letter written as I desire, you may come to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away walked Lady Barbara, as cool and unmoved apparently
as if she had been made of cast iron; though within she was as
sorry, and hardly less angry, than the poor frantic child she
left.</p>
<p>Kate did not fly about now.&nbsp; She was very indignant, but
she was proud of herself too; she had spoken as if she had been
in a book, and she believed herself persecuted for adhering to
old friends, and refusing to adopt fashionable falsehoods, such
as she had read of.&nbsp; She was a heroine in her own eyes, and
that made her inclined to magnify all the persecution and
cruelty.&nbsp; They wanted to shut her up from the friends of her
childhood, to force her to be false and fashionable; they had
made her naughtier and naughtier ever since she came there; they
were teaching her to tell falsehoods now, and to give up the
Wardours.&nbsp; She would never never do it!&nbsp; Helpless girl
as she was, she would be as brave as the knights and earls her
ancestors, and stand up for the truth.&nbsp; But what would they
do at her!&nbsp; Oh! could she bear Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s dreadful
set Diana face again, and not write as she was told!</p>
<p>The poor weak little heart shrank with terror as she only
looked at Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s chair&mdash;not much like the Sir
Giles de Umfraville she had thought of just now.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m naughty now; I did betray my trust: I&rsquo;m much
naughtier than I was.&nbsp; Oh, if Papa was but
here!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then a light darted into Kate&rsquo;s eye,
and a smile came on her lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should not I go
home?&nbsp; Papa would have me again; I know he would!&nbsp; He
would die rather than leave his child Kate to be made wicked, and
forced to tell lies!&nbsp; Perhaps he&rsquo;ll hide me!&nbsp; Oh,
if I could go to school with the children at home in disguise,
and let Uncle Giles be Earl of Caergwent if he likes!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve had enough of grandeur!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come as
Cardinal Wolsey did, when he said he was come to lay his bones
among them&mdash;and Sylvia and Mary, and Charlie and
Armyn&mdash;oh, I must go where someone will be kind to me
again!&nbsp; Can I really, though?&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo; and her
heart beat violently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes; nothing would happen
to me; I know how to manage!&nbsp; If I can only get there, they
will hide me from Aunt Barbara and the Lord Chancellor; and even
if I had to go back, I should have had one kiss of them
all.&nbsp; Perhaps if I don&rsquo;t go now I shall never see them
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With thoughts something like these, Kate, moving dreamily, as
if she were not sure that it was herself or not, opened her
little writing-case, took out her purse, and counted the
money.&nbsp; There was a sovereign and some silver; more than
enough, as she well knew.&nbsp; Then she took out of a
chiffoniere her worked travelling bag, and threw in a few
favourite books; then stood and gasped, and opened the door to
peep out.&nbsp; The coachman was waiting at the bottom of the
stairs for orders, so she drew in her head, looked at her watch,
and considered whether her room would be clear of the
housemaids.&nbsp; If she could once get safely out of the house
she would not be missed till her dinner time, and perhaps then
might be supposed sullen, and left alone.&nbsp; She was in a
state of great fright, starting violently at every sound; but the
scheme having once occurred to her, it seemed as if St.
James&rsquo;s Parsonage was pulling her harder and harder every
minute; she wondered if there were really such things as
heart-strings; if there were, hers must be fastened very tight
round Sylvia.</p>
<p>At last she ventured out, and flew up to her own room more
swiftly than ever she had darted before!&nbsp; She moved about
quietly, and perceived by the sounds in the next room that Mrs.
Bartley was dressing Aunt Jane, and Aunt Barbara reading a letter
to her.&nbsp; This was surely a good moment; but she knew she
must dress herself neatly, and not look scared, if she did not
mean to be suspected and stopped; and she managed to get quietly
into her little shaggy coat, her black hat and feather and warm
gloves&mdash;even her boots were remembered&mdash;and then
whispering to herself, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be wrong to get away
from being made to tell stories!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to
Papa!&rdquo; she softly opened the door, went on tip-toe past
Lady&rsquo;s Jane&rsquo;s door; then after the first flight of
stairs, rushed like the wind, unseen by anyone, got the street
door open, pulled it by its outside handle, and heard it
shut!</p>
<p>It was done now!&nbsp; She was on the wide world&mdash;in the
street!&nbsp; She could not have got in again without knocking,
ringing, and making her attempt known; and she was far more
terrified at the thought of Lady Barbara&rsquo;s stern face and
horror at her proceedings than even at the long journey
alone.</p>
<p>Every step was a little bit nearer Sylvia, Mary, and
Papa&mdash;it made her heart bound in the midst of its frightened
throbs&mdash;every step was farther away from Aunt Barbara, and
she could hardly help setting off in a run.&nbsp; It was a foggy
day, when it was not so easy to see far, but she longed to be out
of Bruton Street, where she might be known; yet when beyond the
quiet familiar houses, the sense of being alone, left to herself,
began to get very alarming, and she could hardly control herself
to walk like a rational person to the cab-stand in Davies
Street.</p>
<p>Nobody remarked her; she was a tall girl for her age, and in
her sober dark dress, with her little bag, might be taken for a
tradesman&rsquo;s daughter going to school, even if anyone had
been out who had time to look at her.&nbsp; Trembling, she saw a
cabman make a sign to her, and stood waiting for him, jumped in
as he opened his door, and felt as if she had found a refuge for
the time upon the dirty red plush cushions and the straw.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To the Waterloo Station,&rdquo; said she, with as much
indifference and self-possession as she could manage.&nbsp; The
man touched his hat, and rattled off: he perhaps wondering if
this were a young runaway, and if he should get anything by
telling where she was gone; she working herself into a terrible
fright for fear he should be going to drive round and round
London, get her into some horrible den of iniquity, and murder
her for the sake of her money, her watch, and her clothes.&nbsp;
Did not cabmen always do such things?&nbsp; She had quite decided
how she would call a policeman, and either die like an Umfraville
or offer a ransom of &ldquo;untold gold,&rdquo; and had gone
through all possible catastrophes long before she found herself
really safe at the railway station, and the man letting her out,
and looking for his money.</p>
<p>The knowledge that all depended on herself, and that any signs
of alarm would bring on inquiry, made her able to speak and act
so reasonably, that she felt like one in a dream.&nbsp; With
better fortune than she could have hoped for, a train was going
to start in a quarter of an hour; and the station clerk was much
too busy and too much hurried to remark how scared were her eyes,
and how trembling her voice, as she asked at his pigeon-hole for
&ldquo;A first-class ticket to Oldburgh, if you please,&rdquo;
offered the sovereign in payment, swept up the change, and crept
out to the platform.</p>
<p>A carriage had &ldquo;Oldburgh&rdquo; marked on it; she tried
to open the door, but could not reach the handle; then fancied a
stout porter who came up with his key must be some messenger of
the Lord Chancellor come to catch her, and was very much relieved
when he only said, &ldquo;Where for, Miss?&rdquo; and on her
answer, &ldquo;Oldburgh,&rdquo; opened the door for her, and held
her bag while she tripped up the steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any luggage,
Miss?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shot one
inquiring glance after her, but hastened away; and she settled
herself in the very farthest corner of the carriage, and lived in
an agony for the train to set off before her flight should be
detected.</p>
<p>Once off, she did not care; she should be sure of at least
seeing Sylvia, and telling her uncle her troubles.&nbsp; She had
one great start, when the door was opened, and a gentleman peered
in; but it was merely to see if there was room, for she heard him
say, &ldquo;Only a child,&rdquo; and in came a lady and two
gentlemen, who at least filled up the window so that nobody could
see her, while they talked a great deal to someone on the
platform.&nbsp; And then after some bell-ringing, whistling,
sailing backwards and forwards, and stopping, they were fairly
off&mdash;getting away from the roofs of London&mdash;seeing the
sky clear of smoke and fog&mdash;getting nearer home every
moment; and Countess Kate relaxed her shy, frightened, drawn-up
attitude, gave a long breath, felt that the deed was done, and
began to dwell on the delight with which she should be greeted at
home, and think how to surprise them all!</p>
<p>There was plenty of time for thinking and planning and
dreaming, some few possible things, but a great many more most
impossible ones.&nbsp; Perhaps the queerest notion of all was her
plan for being disguised like a school-child all day, and always
noticed for her distinguished appearance by ladies who came to
see the school, or overheard talking French to Sylvia; and then
in the midst of her exceeding anxiety not to be detected, she
could not help looking at her travelling companions, and
wondering if they guessed with what a grand personage they had
the honour to be travelling!&nbsp; Only a child, indeed!&nbsp;
What would they think if they knew?&nbsp; And the little goose
held her pocket-handkerchief in her hand, feeling as if it would
be like a story if they happened to wonder at the coronet
embroidered in the corner; and when she took out a story-book,
she would have liked that the fly-leaf should just carelessly
reveal the Caergwent written upon it.&nbsp; She did not know that
selfishness had thrown out the branch of self-consequence.</p>
<p>However, nothing came of it; they had a great deal too much to
say to each other to notice the little figure in the corner; and
she had time to read a good deal, settle a great many fine
speeches, get into many a fright lest there should be an
accident, and finally grow very impatient, alarmed, and agitated
before the last station but one was passed, and she began to know
the cut of the hedgerow-trees, and the shape of the
hills&mdash;to feel as if the cattle and sheep in the fields were
old friends, and to feel herself at home.</p>
<p>Oldburgh Station!&nbsp; They were stopping at last, and she
was on her feet, pressing to the window between the
strangers.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen kindly made signs to the
porter to let her out, and asked if she had any baggage, or
anyone to meet her.&nbsp; She thanked him by a smile and shake of
the head; she could not speak for the beating of her heart; she
felt almost as much upon the world as when the door in Bruton
Street had shut behind her; and besides, a terrible wild fancy
had seized her&mdash;suppose, just suppose, they were all gone
away, or ill, or someone dead!&nbsp; Perhaps she felt it would
serve her right, and that was the reason she was in such
terror.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Kate had left the train, she
was still two miles from St. James&rsquo;s; and it was half-past
three o&rsquo;clock, so that she began to feel that she had run
away without her dinner, and that the beatings of her heart made
her knees ache, so that she had no strength to walk.</p>
<p>She thought her best measure would be to make her way to a
pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop that looked straight down the street to
the Grammar School, and where it was rather a habit of the family
to meet Charlie when they had gone into the town on business, and
wanted to walk out with him.&nbsp; He would be out at four
o&rsquo;clock, and there would not be long to wait.&nbsp; So,
feeling shy, and even more guilty and frightened than on her
first start, Kate threaded the streets she knew so well, and
almost gasping with nervous alarm, popped up the steps into the
shop, and began instantly eating a bun, and gazing along the
street.&nbsp; She really could not speak till she had swallowed a
few mouthfuls; and then she looked up to the woman, and took
courage to ask if the boys were out of school yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss; not for a quarter of an hour
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know if&mdash;if Master Charles Wardour is there
to-day?&rdquo; added Kate, with a gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, Miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the woman looked
hard at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know if any of them&mdash;any of them from St.
James&rsquo;s, are in to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss; I have not seen any of them, but very likely
they may be.&nbsp; I saw Mr. Wardour go by yesterday
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far they were all well, then; and Kate made her mind
easier, and went on eating like a hungry child till the great
clock struck four; when she hastily paid for her cakes and tarts,
put on her gloves, and stood on the step, half in and half out of
the shop, staring down the street.&nbsp; Out came the boys in a
rush, making straight for the shop, and brushing past Kate; she,
half alarmed, half affronted, descended from her post, still
looking intently.&nbsp; Half a dozen more big fellows, eagerly
talking, almost tumbled over her, and looked as if she had no
business there; she seemed to be quite swept off the pavement
into the street, and to be helpless in the midst of a mob,
dashing around her.&nbsp; They might begin to tease her in a
minute; and more terrified than at any moment of her journey, she
was almost ready to cry, when the tones of a well-known voice
came on her ear close to her&mdash;&ldquo;I say, Will, you come
and see my new terrier;&rdquo; and before the words were uttered,
with a cry of, &ldquo;Charlie, Charlie!&rdquo; she was clinging
to a stout boy who had been passing without looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go, I say.&nbsp; Who are you?&rdquo; was the first
rough greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Charlie, Charlie!&rdquo; almost sobbing, and still
grasping his arm tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; and he stood with open mouth staring
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Charlie! take me home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; come along!&mdash;Get off with you,
fellows!&rdquo; he added&mdash;turning round upon the other boys,
who were beginning to stare&mdash;and exclaimed,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but our Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! what a thrill there was in hearing those words; and the
boys, who were well-behaved and gentlemanly, were not inclined to
molest her.&nbsp; So she hurried on, holding Charles&rsquo;s arm
for several steps, till they were out of the hubbub, when he
turned again and stared, and again exclaimed, &ldquo;I
say!&rdquo; all that he could at present utter; and Kate looked
at his ruddy face and curly head, and dusty coat and inky collar,
as if she would eat him for very joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; and this time he really did say,
&ldquo;Where are the rest of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At home, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, didn&rsquo;t they bring you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t make a tomfoolery of it; that&rsquo;s
enough.&nbsp; I shall have all the fellows at me for your coming
up in that way, you know.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t you shake
hands like anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Charlie, I couldn&rsquo;t help it!&nbsp; Please let
us go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you aren&rsquo;t come from
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kate, half ashamed, but far more
exultant, and hanging down her head; &ldquo;I came from
London&mdash;I came by myself.&nbsp; My aunt wanted me to tell a
story, and&mdash;and I have run away.&nbsp; O Charlie! take me
home!&rdquo; and with a fresh access of alarm, she again threw
her arms round him, as if to gain his protection from some
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; again he cried, looking up the empty
street and down again, partly for the enemy, partly to avoid
eyes; but he only beheld three dirty children and an old woman,
so he did not throw her off roughly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ran
away!&rdquo; and he gave a great whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; My aunt shut me up because I would not
tell a story,&rdquo; said Kate, really believing it
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, let us get home, Charlie,
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if you won&rsquo;t throttle a man; and let
me get Tony in here,&rdquo; he added, going on a little way
towards a small inn stable-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; cried Kate, who, once more
protected, could not bear to be left alone a moment; but Charlie
plunged into the yard, and came back not only with the pony, but
with a plaid, and presently managed to mount Kate upon the
saddle, throwing the plaid round her so as to hide the short
garments and long scarlet stockings, that were not adapted for
riding, all with a boy&rsquo;s rough and tender care for the
propriety of his sister&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that will do,&rdquo; said he, holding the
bridle.&nbsp; &ldquo;So you found it poor fun being My Lady, and
all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it was awful, Charlie!&nbsp; You little know, in
your peaceful retirement, what are the miseries of the
great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Kate, don&rsquo;t talk bosh out of your
books.&nbsp; What did they do to you?&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t
lick you, did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; nonsense,&rdquo; said Kate, rather affronted;
&ldquo;but they wanted to make me forget all that I cared for,
and they really did shut me up because I said I would not write a
falsehood to please them!&nbsp; They did, Charlie!&rdquo; and her
eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I always knew they must be a couple of horrid old
owls,&rdquo; began Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mean Aunt Jane,&rdquo; said
Kate, feeling a little compunction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; with
a start and scream, &ldquo;who is coming?&rdquo; as she heard
steps behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little donkey, you&rsquo;ll be off!&nbsp; Who
should it be but Armyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Armyn generally overtook his brother on a Saturday, and
walked home with him for the Sunday.</p>
<p>Charles hailed him with a loud &ldquo;Hollo, Armyn!&nbsp; What
d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ve got here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate!&nbsp; Why, how d&rsquo;ye do!&nbsp; Why, they
never told me you were coming to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; whispered Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s run away, like a jolly brick!&rdquo; said
Charlie, patting the pony vehemently as he made this most
inappropriate comparison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; cried
Armyn, standing still and aghast, so much shocked that her
elevation turned into shame; and Charles answered for
her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure she did, when they locked her up
because she wouldn&rsquo;t tell lies to please them.&nbsp; How
did you get out, Kittens?&nbsp; What jolly good fun it must have
been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this so, Kate?&rdquo; said Armyn, laying his hand on
the bridle; and his displeasure roused her spirit of
self-defence, and likewise a sense of ill-usage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it is,&rdquo; she said, raising her head
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not be made to tell fashionable
falsehoods; and so&mdash;and so I came home, for Papa to protect
me:&rdquo; and if she had not had to take care to steady herself
on her saddle, she would have burst out sobbing with vexation at
Armyn&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one knew you were coming?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not; I slipped out while they were all in
confabulation in Aunt Jane&rsquo;s room, and they were sure not
to find me gone till dinner time, and if they are very cross, not
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on, Charlie,&rdquo; said Armyn, restoring the
bridle to his brother; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll overtake you by the time
you get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; cried boy and girl
with one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it is fair to tell you,&rdquo; said
Armyn.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go and telegraph what is become of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a howl and a shriek at this.&nbsp; They would come
after her and take her away, when she only wanted to be hid and
kept safe; it was a cruel shame, and Charles was ready to fly at
his brother and pommel him; indeed, Armyn had to hold him by one
shoulder, and say in the voice that meant that he would be
minded, &ldquo;Steady, boy I&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry, my
little Katie; it&rsquo;s a melancholy matter, but you must have
left those poor old ladies in a dreadful state of alarm about
you, and they ought not to be kept in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but Armyn, Armyn, do only get home, and see what
Papa says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain what he will say, and it would only be the
trouble of sending someone in, and keeping the poor women in a
fright all the longer.&nbsp; Besides, depend on it, the way to
have them sending down after you would be to say nothing.&nbsp;
Now, if they hear you are safe, you are pretty secure of spending
to-morrow at least with us.&nbsp; Let me go, Kate; it must be
done.&nbsp; I cannot help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even while he spoke, the kind way of crossing her will was so
like home, that it gave a sort of happiness, and she felt she
could not resist; so she gave a sigh, and he turned back.</p>
<p>How much of the joy and hope of her journey had he not carried
away with him!&nbsp; His manner of treating her exploit made her
even doubt how his father might receive it; and yet the sight of
old scenes, and the presence of Charlie, was such exceeding
delight, that it seemed to kill off all unpleasant fears or
anticipations; and all the way home it was one happy chatter of
inquiries for everyone, of bits of home news, and exclamations at
the sight of some well-known tree, or the outline of a house
remembered for some adventure; the darker the twilight the
happier her tongue.&nbsp; The dull suburb, all little pert square
red-brick houses, with slated roofs and fine names, in the
sloppiness of a grey November day, was dear to Kate; every little
shop window with the light streaming out was like a friend; and
she anxiously gazed into the rough parties out for their Saturday
purchases, intending to nod to anyone she might know, but it was
too dark for recognitions; and when at length they passed the
dark outline of the church, she was silent, her heart again
bouncing as if it would beat away her breath and senses.&nbsp;
The windows were dark; it was a sign that Evening Service was
just over.&nbsp; The children turned in at the gate, just as
Armyn overtook them.&nbsp; He lifted Kate off her pony.&nbsp; She
could not have stood, but she could run, and she flew to the
drawing-room.&nbsp; No one was there; perhaps she was glad.&nbsp;
She knew the cousins would be dressing for tea, and in another
moment she had torn open Sylvia&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Sylvia, who was brushing her hair, turned round.&nbsp; She
stared&mdash;as if she had seen a ghost.&nbsp; Then the two
children held out their arms, and rushed together with a wild
scream that echoed through the house, and brought Mary flying out
of her room to see who was hurt! and to find, rolling on her
sister&rsquo;s bed, a thing that seemed to have two bodies and
two faces glued together, four legs, and all its arms and hands
wound round and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; What
is she doing to you?&rdquo; began Mary; but before the words were
out of her mouth, the thing had flown at her neck, and pulled her
down too; and the grasp and the clinging and the kisses told her
long before she had room or eyes or voice to know the creature
by.&nbsp; A sort of sobbing out of each name between them was all
that was heard at first.</p>
<p>At last, just as Mary was beginning to say, &ldquo;My own own
Katie! how did you come&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s
voice on the stairs called &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; but Kate was afraid now she had heard his
voice, for it was grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mary went.&nbsp; Kate sat up,
holding Sylvia&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>They heard him ask, &ldquo;Is Kate there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then there were lower voices that
Kate could not hear, and which therefore alarmed her; and Sylvia,
puzzled and frightened, sat holding her hand, listening
silently.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Wardour came in; and his look was graver than
his tone; but it was so pitying, that in a moment Kate flew to
his breast, and as he held her in his arms she cried, &ldquo;O
Papa!&nbsp; Papa!&nbsp; I have found you again! you will not turn
me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do whatever may be right, my dear child,&rdquo;
said Mr. Wardour, holding her close, so that she felt his deep
love, though it was not an undoubting welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will hear all about it when you have rested, and then I may know
what is best to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! keep me, keep me, Papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be here to-morrow at least,&rdquo; he said,
disengaging himself from her.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a terrible
proceeding of yours, Kate, but it is no time for talking of it;
and as your aunts know where you are, nothing more can be done at
present; so we will wait to understand it till you are rested and
composed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away; and Kate remained sobered and confused, and Mary
stood looking at her, sad and perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Kate!&nbsp; Kate!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what have
you been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; Are not you glad?&rdquo;
cried Sylvia; and the squeeze of her hand restored Kate&rsquo;s
spirits so much that she broke forth with her story, told in her
own way, of persecution and escape, as she had wrought herself up
to believe in it; and Sylvia clung to her, with flushed cheeks
and ardent eyes, resenting every injury that her darling
detailed, triumphing in her resistance, and undoubting that here
she would be received and sheltered from all; while Mary,
distressed and grieved, and cautioned by her father to take care
not to show sympathy that might be mischievous, was carried along
in spite of herself to admire and pity her child, and burn with
indignation at such ill-treatment, almost in despair at the idea
that the child must be sent back again, yet still not discarding
that trust common to all Mr. Wardour&rsquo;s children, that
&ldquo;Papa would do <i>anything</i> to hinder a
temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, with eager words and tender hands, Kate was made ready
for the evening meal, and went down, clinging on one side to
Mary, on the other to Sylvia&mdash;a matter of no small
difficulty on the narrow staircase, and almost leading to a
general avalanche of young ladies, all upon the head of little
Lily, who was running up to greet and be greeted, and was almost
devoured by Kate when at length they did get safe downstairs.</p>
<p>It was a somewhat quiet, grave meal; Mr. Wardour looked so sad
and serious, that all felt that it would not do to indulge in
joyous chatter, and the little girls especially were awed; though
through all there was a tender kindness in his voice and look,
whenever he did but offer a slice of bread to his little guest,
such as made her feel what was home and what was
love&mdash;&ldquo;like a shower of rain after a parched
desert&rdquo; as she said to herself; and she squeezed
Sylvia&rsquo;s hand under the table whenever she could.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour spoke to her very little.&nbsp; He said he had
seen Colonel Umfraville&rsquo;s name in the <i>Gazette</i>, and
asked about his coming home; and when she had answered that the
time and speed of the journey were to depend on Giles&rsquo;s
health, he turned from her to Armyn, and began talking to him
about some public matters that seemed very dull to Kate; and one
little foolish voice within her said, &ldquo;He is not like Mrs.
George Wardour, he forgets what I am;&rdquo; but there was a
wiser, more loving voice to answer, &ldquo;Dear Papa, he thinks
of me as myself; he is no respecter of persons.&nbsp; Oh, I hope
he is not angry with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When tea was over Mr. Wardour stood up, and said, &ldquo;I
shall wish you children good-night now; I have to read with John
Bailey for his Confirmation, and to prepare for
to-morrow;&mdash;and you, Kate, must go to bed early.&mdash;Mary,
she had better sleep with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather a blank, for sleeping with Sylvia again had
been Kate&rsquo;s dream of felicity; yet this was almost lost in
the sweetness of once more coming in turn for the precious kiss
and good-night, in the midst of which she faltered, &ldquo;O
Papa, don&rsquo;t be angry with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not angry, Katie,&rdquo; he said gently; &ldquo;I
am very sorry.&nbsp; You have done a thing that nothing can
justify, and that may do you much future harm; and I cannot
receive you as if you had come properly.&nbsp; I do not know what
excuse there was for you, and I cannot attend to you to-night;
indeed, I do not think you could tell me rightly; but another
time we will talk it all over, and I will try to help you.&nbsp;
Now good-night, my dear child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words of his, &ldquo;I will try to help you,&rdquo; were
to Kate like a promise of certain rescue from all her troubles;
and, elastic ball that her nature was, no sooner was his anxious
face out of sight, and she secure that he was not angry, than up
bounded her spirits again.&nbsp; She began wondering why Papa
thought she could not tell him properly, and forthwith began to
give what she intended for a full and particular history of all
that she had gone through.</p>
<p>It was a happy party round the fire; Kate and Sylvia both
together in the large arm-chair, and Lily upon one of its arms;
Charles in various odd attitudes before the fire; Armyn at the
table with his book, half reading, half listening; Mary with her
work; and Kate pouring out her story, making herself her own
heroine, and describing her adventures, her way of life, and all
her varieties of miseries, in the most glowing colours.&nbsp; How
she did rattle on!&nbsp; It would be a great deal too much to
tell; indeed it would be longer than this whole story!</p>
<p>Sylvia and Charlie took it all in, pitied, wondered, and were
indignant, with all their hearts; indeed Charlie was once heard
to wish he could only get that horrid old witch near the
horse-pond; and when Kate talked of her Diana face, he declared
that he should get the old brute of a cat into the field, and set
all the boys to stone her.</p>
<p>Little Lily listened, not sure whether it was not all what she
called &ldquo;a made-up story only for prettiness;&rdquo; and
Mary, sitting over her work, was puzzled, and saw that her father
was right in saying that Kate could not at present give an
accurate account of herself.&nbsp; Mary knew her truthfulness,
and that she would not have said what she knew to be invention;
but those black eyes, glowing like little hot coals, and those
burning cheeks, as well as the loud, squeaky key of the voice,
all showed that she had worked herself up into a state of
excitement, such as not to know what was invented by an
exaggerating memory.&nbsp; Besides, it could not be all true; it
did not agree; the ill-treatment was not consistent with the
grandeur.&nbsp; For Kate had taken to talking very big, as if she
was an immensely important personage, receiving much respect
wherever she went; and though Armyn once or twice tried putting
in a sober matter-of-fact question for the fun of disconcerting
her, she was too mad to care or understand what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! she never was allowed to do anything for
herself.&nbsp; That was quite a rule, and very tiresome it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the King of Spain, you can&rsquo;t move your chair
away from the fire without the proper attendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never do put on coals or wood there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be several reasons for that,&rdquo; said
Armyn, recollecting how nearly Kate had once burnt the house
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I assure you it would not do for me,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it were not so inconvenient in that little
house, I should have my own man-servant to attend to my fire, and
walk out behind me.&nbsp; Indeed, now Perkins always does walk
behind me, and it is such a bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what was the consequence of all this wild chatter?&nbsp;
When Mary had seen the hot-faced eager child into bed, she came
down to her brother in the drawing-room with her eyes brimful of
tears, saying, &ldquo;Poor dear child!&nbsp; I am afraid she is
very much spoilt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make up your mind to-night,&rdquo; said
Armyn.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is slightly insane as yet!&nbsp; Never
mind, Mary; her heart is in the right place, if her head is
turned a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very much turned indeed,&rdquo; said Mary.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How wise it was of Papa not to let Sylvia sleep with
her!&nbsp; What will he do with her?&nbsp; Oh dear!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunday at Oldburgh was not
spent as Kate would have had it.&nbsp; It dawned upon her in the
midst of horrid dreams, ending by wakening to an overpowering
sick headache, the consequence of the agitations and alarms of
the previous day, and the long fast, appeased by the contents of
the pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop, with the journey and the excitement
of the meeting&mdash;altogether quite sufficient to produce such
a miserable feeling of indisposition, that if Kate could have
thought at all of anything but present wretchedness, she would
have feared that she was really carrying out the likeness to
Cardinal Wolsey by laying her bones among them.</p>
<p>That it was not quite so bad as that, might be inferred from
her having no doctor but Mary Wardour, who attended to her most
assiduously from her first moans at four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, till her dropping off to sleep about noon; when the
valiant Mary, in the absence of everyone at church, took upon
herself to pen a note, to catch the early Sunday post, on her own
responsibility, to Lady Barbara Umfraville, to say that her
little cousin was so unwell that it would be impossible to carry
out the promise of bringing her home on Monday, which Mr. Wardour
had written on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Sleep considerably repaired her little ladyship; and when she
had awakened, and supped up a bason of beef-tea, toast and all,
with considerable appetite, she was so much herself again, that
there was no reason that anyone should be kept at home to attend
to her.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s absence was extremely inconvenient, as
she was organist and leader of the choir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Katie dear,&rdquo; she said, when she saw her
patient on her legs again, making friends with the last new
kitten of the old cat, &ldquo;you will not mind being left alone,
will you?&nbsp; It is only for the Litany and catechising, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate looked blank, and longed to ask that Sylvia might stay
with her, but did not venture; knowing that she was not ill
enough for it to be a necessity, and that no one in that house
was ever kept from church, except for some real and sufficient
cause.</p>
<p>But the silly thoughts that passed through the little head in
the hour of solitude would fill two or three volumes.&nbsp; In
the first place, she was affronted.&nbsp; They made very little
of her, considering who she was, and how she had come to see them
at all risks, and how ill she had been!&nbsp; They would hardly
have treated a little village child so negligently as their
visitor, the Countess&mdash;</p>
<p>Then her heart smote her.&nbsp; She remembered Mary&rsquo;s
tender and assiduous nursing all the morning, and how she had
already stayed from service and Sunday school; and she
recollected her honour for her friends for not valuing her for
her rank; and in that mood she looked out the Psalms and Lessons,
which she had not been able to read in the morning, and when she
had finished them, began to examine the book-case in search of a
new, or else a very dear old, Sunday book.</p>
<p>But then something went &ldquo;crack,&rdquo;&mdash;or else it
was Kate&rsquo;s fancy&mdash;for she started as if it had been a
cannon-ball; and though she sat with her book in her lap by the
fire in Mary&rsquo;s room, all the dear old furniture and
pictures round her, her head was weaving an unheard-of
imagination, about robbers coming in rifling
everything&mdash;coming up the stairs&mdash;creak, creak, was
that their step?&mdash;she held her breath, and her eyes
dilated&mdash;seizing her for the sake of her watch!&nbsp; What
article there would be in the paper&mdash;&ldquo;Melancholy
disappearance of the youthful Countess of Caergwent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then Aunt Barbara would be sorry she had treated her so cruelly;
then Mary would know she ought not to have abandoned the child
who had thrown herself on her protection.</p>
<p>That was the way Lady Caergwent spent her hour.&nbsp; She had
been kidnapped and murdered a good many times before; there was a
buzz in the street, her senses came back, and she sprang out on
the stairs to meet her cousins, calling herself quite well
again.&nbsp; And then they had a very peaceful, pleasant time;
she was one of them again, when, as of old, Mr. Wardour came into
the drawing-room, and she stood up with Charles, Sylvia, and
little Lily, who was now old enough for the Catechism, and then
the Collect, and a hymn.&nbsp; Yes, she had Collect and hymn
ready too, and some of the Gospel; Aunt Barbara always heard her
say them on Sunday, besides some very difficult questions, not at
all like what Mr. Wardour asked out of his own head.</p>
<p>Kate was a little afraid he would make his teaching turn on
submitting to rulers; it was an Epistle that would have given him
a good opportunity, for it was the Fourth Epiphany Sunday,
brought in at the end of the Sundays after Trinity.&nbsp; If he
made his teaching personal, something within her wondered if she
could bear it, and was ready to turn angry and defiant.&nbsp; But
no such thing; what he talked to them about was the gentle
Presence that hushed the waves and winds in outward nature, and
calmed the wild spiritual torments of the possessed; and how all
fears and terrors, all foolish fancies and passionate tempers,
will be softened into peace when the thought of Him rises in the
heart.</p>
<p>Kate wondered if she should be able to think of that next time
she was going to work herself into an agony.</p>
<p>But at present all was like a precious dream, to be enjoyed as
slowly as the moments could be persuaded to pass.&nbsp; Out came
the dear old Dutch Bible History, with pictures of
everything&mdash;pictures that they had looked at every Sunday
since they could walk, and could have described with their eyes
shut; and now Kate was to feast her eyes once again upon them,
and hear how many little Lily knew; and a pretty sight it was,
that tiny child, with her fat hands clasped behind her so as not
to be tempted to put a finger on the print, going so happily and
thoroughly through all the creatures that came to Adam to be
named, and showing the whole procession into the Ark, and, her
favourite of all, the Angels coming down to Jacob.</p>
<p>Then came tea; and then Kate was pronounced, to her great
delight, well enough for Evening Service.&nbsp; The Evening
Service she always thought a treat, with the lighted church, and
the choicest singing&mdash;the only singing that had ever taken
hold of Kate&rsquo;s tuneless ear, and that seemed to come home
to her.&nbsp; At least, to-night it came home as it had never
done before; it seemed to touch some tender spot in her heart,
and when she thought how dear it was, and how little she had
cared about it, and how glad she had been to go away, she found
the candles dancing in a green mist, and great drops came down
upon the Prayer-book in her hand.</p>
<p>Then it could not be true that she had no feeling.&nbsp; She
was crying&mdash;the first time she had ever known herself cry
except for pain or at reproof; and she was really so far pleased,
that she made no attempt to stop the great tears that came
trickling down at each familiar note, at each thought how long it
had been since she had heard them.&nbsp; She cried all church
time; for whenever she tried to attend to the prayers, the very
sound of the voice she loved so well set her off again; and
Sylvia, tenderly laying a hand on her by way of sympathy, made
her weep the more, though still so softly and gently that it was
like a strange sort of happiness&mdash;almost better than joy and
merriment.&nbsp; And then the sermon&mdash;upon the text,
&ldquo;Peace, be still,&rdquo;&mdash;was on the same thought on
which her uncle had talked to the children: not that she followed
it much; the very words &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;be
still,&rdquo; seemed to be enough to touch, soften, and dissolve
her into those sweet comfortable tears.</p>
<p>Perhaps they partly came from the weakening of the
morning&rsquo;s indisposition; at any rate, when she moved, after
the Blessing, holding the pitying Sylvia&rsquo;s hand, she found
that she was very much tired, her eyelids were swollen and
aching, and in fact she was fit for nothing but bed, where Mary
and Sylvia laid her; and she slept, and slept in dreamless
soundness, till she was waked by Mary&rsquo;s getting up in the
morning, and found herself perfectly well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Sylvia,&rdquo; she said, as they went
downstairs hand-in-hand, &ldquo;let us put it all out of our
heads, and try and think all day that it is just one of our old
times, and that I am your old Kate.&nbsp; Let me do my lessons
and go into school, and have some fun, and quite forget all that
is horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was something to come before this happy return to
old times.&nbsp; As soon as breakfast was over Mr Wardour said,
&ldquo;Now, Kate, I want you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she knew what
was coming; and somehow, she did not feel exactly the same about
her exploit and its causes by broad daylight, now that she was
cool.&nbsp; Perhaps she would have been glad to hang back; yet on
the whole, she had a great deal to say to &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; and
it was a relief, though rather terrific, to find herself alone
with him in the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Kate,&rdquo; said he again, with his arm round
her, as she stood by him, &ldquo;will you tell me what led you to
this very sad and strange proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate hung her head, and ran her fingers along the mouldings of
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was it, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wardour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was&mdash;&rdquo; and she grew bolder at the sound
of her own voice, and more confident in the goodness of her
cause&mdash;&ldquo;it was because Aunt Barbara said I must write
what was not true, and&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll never tell a
falsehood&mdash;never, for no one!&rdquo; and her eyes
flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, Kate,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand upon
hers; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what you never
<i>will</i> do, only what you have done.&nbsp; What was this
falsehood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Papa, the other Sylvia&mdash;Sylvia Joanna, you
know&mdash;has her birthday to-day, and we settled at Bournemouth
that I should spend the day with her; and on Saturday, when Aunt
Barbara heard of it, she said she did not want me to be intimate
there, and that I must not go, and told me to write a note to say
she had made a previous engagement for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know that she had not done so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Papa! she could not; for when I said I would not
write a lie, she never said it was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that what you said to your aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;and Kate hung her head&mdash;&ldquo;I
was in a passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Kate, I do not wonder that Lady Barbara insisted
on obedience, instead of condescending to argue with a child who
could be so insolent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Papa,&rdquo; said Kate, abashed for a moment, then
getting eager, &ldquo;she does tell fashionable falsehoods; she
says she is not at home when she is, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Kate; it is not for you to judge of grown
people&rsquo;s doings.&nbsp; Neither I nor Mary would like to use
that form of denying ourselves; but it is usually understood to
mean only not ready to receive visitors.&nbsp; In the same way,
this previous engagement was evidently meant to make the refusal
less discourteous, and you were not even certain it did not
exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Italian mistress did want to come on Monday,&rdquo;
faltered Kate, &ldquo;but it was not
&lsquo;previous.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Kate, who was it that went beside the mark in
letting us believe that Lady Barbara locked you up to make you
tell falsehoods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Papa, I did not say locked&mdash;Charlie and
Sylvia said that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you correct them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Papa, I did not mean it!&nbsp; But I am naughty
now!&nbsp; I always am naughty, so much worse than I used to be
at home.&nbsp; Indeed I am, and I never do get into a good vein
now.&nbsp; O Papa, Papa, can&rsquo;t you get me out of it
all?&nbsp; If you could only take me home again!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think my aunts want to keep me&mdash;they say I am so
bad and horrid, and that I make Aunt Jane ill.&nbsp; Oh, take me
back, Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did take her on his knee, and held her close to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish I could, my dear,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I should
like to have you again! but it cannot be.&nbsp; It is a different
state of life that has been appointed for you; and you would not
be allowed to make your home with me, with no older a person than
Mary to manage for you.&nbsp; If your aunt had not been taken
from us, then&mdash;&rdquo; and Kate ventured to put her arm
round his neck&mdash;&ldquo;then this would have been your
natural home; but as things are with us, I could not make my
house such as would suit the requirements of those who arrange
for you.&nbsp; And, my poor child, I fear we let the very faults
spring up that are your sorrow now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, Papa, you helped me!&nbsp; Aunt Barbara only
makes me&mdash;oh! may I say?&mdash;hate her! for indeed there is
no helping it!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be good there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; What do you mean, my dear?&nbsp; What
is your difficulty?&nbsp; And I will try to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Kate found it not at all easy to explain when she came to
particulars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always cross,&rdquo; was the clearest
idea in her mind; &ldquo;never pleased with her, never liking
anything she did&mdash;not punishing, but much
worse.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had not made out her case, she knew; but
she could only murmur again, &ldquo;It all went wrong, and I was
very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour sighed from the bottom of his heart; he was very
sorrowful, too, for the child that was as his own.&nbsp; And then
he went back and thought of his early college friend, and of his
own wife who had so fondled the little orphan&mdash;all that was
left of her sister.&nbsp; It was grievous to him to put that
child away from him when she came clinging to him, and saying she
was unhappy, and led into faults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be better when your uncle comes home,&rdquo; he
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Papa, indeed it will not.&nbsp; Uncle Giles is
more stern than Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; Aunt Jane says it used to
make her quite unhappy to see how sharp he was with poor Giles
and Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw him in his own family,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wardour thoughtfully; &ldquo;but this I know, Kate, that your
father looked up to him, young as he then was, more than to
anyone; that he was the only person among them all who ever
concerned himself about you or your mother; and that on the two
occasions when I saw him, I thought him very like your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather he was like you, Papa,&rdquo; sighed
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if I was but your child!&rdquo; she added,
led on by a little involuntary pressure of his encircling
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk of what is not, but of what
is,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour; &ldquo;let us try to look on things
in their right light.&nbsp; It has been the will of Heaven to
call you, my little girl, to a station where you will, if you
live, have many people&rsquo;s welfare depending on you, and your
example will be of weight with many.&nbsp; You must go through
training for it, and strict training may be the best for
you.&nbsp; Indeed, it must be the best, or it would not have been
permitted to befall you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it does not make me good, it makes me
naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Kate; nothing, nobody can make you naughty; nothing
is strong enough to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate knew what he meant, and hung her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I do believe that you feel forlorn and dreary,
and miss the affection you have had among us; but have you ever
thought of the Friend who is closest of all to us, and who is
especially kind to a fatherless child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t feel it&mdash;Papa, I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And then, why was it made so that I must go
away from you and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see some day, though you cannot see now, my
dear.&nbsp; If you use it rightly, you will feel the
benefit.&nbsp; Meantime, you must take it on trust, just as you
do my love for you, though I am going to carry you
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I can feel you loving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, it only depends on yourself to feel your
Heavenly Father loving you.&nbsp; If you will set yourself to
pray with your heart, and think of His goodness to you, and ask
Him for help and solace in all your present vexatious and
difficulties, never mind how small, you <i>will</i> become
conscious of his tender pity and love to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but I am not good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But He can make you so, Kate.&nbsp; Your have been
wearied by religious teaching hitherto, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except when it was pretty and like poetry,&rdquo;
whispered Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your heart to your prayers now, Kate.&nbsp; Look in
the Psalms for verses to suit your loneliness; recollect that you
meet us in spirit when you use the same Prayers, read the same
Lessons, and think of each other.&nbsp; Or, better still, carry
your troubles to Him; and when you <i>have</i> felt His help, you
will know what that is far better than I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate only answered with a long breath; not feeling as if she
could understand such comfort, but with a resolve to try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, &ldquo;I must take
you home to-morrow, and I will speak for you to Lady Barbara, and
try to obtain her forgiveness; but, Kate, I do not think you
quite understand what a shocking proceeding this was of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it was wrong to fancy <i>that</i>, and say
<i>that</i> about Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell her
so,&rdquo; said Kate, with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will be right; but it was this&mdash;this
expedition that I meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was coming to you, Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Kate; but did you think what an outrageous act it
was?&nbsp; There is something particularly grievous in a little
girl, or a woman of any age, casting off restraint, and setting
out in the world unprotected and contrary to authority.&nbsp; Do
you know, it frightened me so much, that till I saw more of you I
did not like you to be left alone with Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep red colour flushed all over Kate&rsquo;s face and
neck in her angry shame and confusion, burning darker and more
crimson, so that Mr. Wardour was very sorry for her, and added,
&ldquo;I am obliged to say this, because you ought to know that
it is both very wrong in itself, and will be regarded by other
people as more terrible than what you are repenting of
more.&nbsp; So, if you do find yourself distrusted and in
disgrace, you must not think it unjust and cruel, but try to
submit patiently, and learn not to be reckless and
imprudent.&nbsp; My poor child, I wish you could have so come to
us that we might have been happier together.&nbsp; Perhaps you
will some day; and in the meantime, if you have any troubles, or
want to know anything, you may always write to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writing is not speaking,&rdquo; said Kate ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but it comes nearer to it as people get
older.&nbsp; Now go, my dear; I am busy, and you had better make
the most of your time with your cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart was unburthened now; and though there was
much alarm, pain, and grief, in anticipation, yet she felt more
comfortable in herself than she had done for months.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; had never been so tender with her, and she
knew that he had forgiven her.&nbsp; She stept back to the
drawing-room, very gentle and subdued, and tried to carry out her
plans of living one of her old days, by beginning with sharing
the lessons as usual, and then going out with her cousins to
visit the school, and see some of the parishioners.&nbsp; It was
very nice and pleasant; she was as quiet and loving as possible,
and threw herself into all the dear old home matters.&nbsp; It
was as if for a little while Katharine was driven out of
Katharine, and a very sweet little maiden left
instead&mdash;thinking about other things and people instead of
herself, and full of affection and warmth.&nbsp; The improvement
that the half year&rsquo;s discipline had made in her bearing and
manners was visible now; her uncouth abrupt ways were softened,
though still she felt that the naturally gentle and graceful
Sylvia would have made a better countess than she did.</p>
<p>They spent the evening in little tastes of all their favourite
drawing-room games, just for the sake of having tried them once
more; and Papa himself came in and took a share&mdash;a very rare
treat;&mdash;and he always thought of such admirable things in
&ldquo;Twenty questions,&rdquo; and made &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my
thought like?&rdquo; more full of fun than anyone.</p>
<p>It was a very happy evening&mdash;one of the most happy that
Kate had ever passed.&nbsp; She knew <i>how</i> to enjoy her
friends now, and how precious they were to her; and she was just
so much tamed by the morning&rsquo;s conversation, and by the
dread of the future, as not to be betrayed into dangerously high
spirits.&nbsp; That loving, pitying way of Mary&rsquo;s, and her
own Sylvia&rsquo;s exceeding pleasure in having her, were
delightful; and all through she felt the difference between the
real genuine love that she could rest on, and the mere habit of
fondling of the other Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Sylvia,&rdquo; she said, as they walked upstairs,
hand in hand, pausing on every stop to make it longer, &ldquo;how
could I be so glad to go away before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; as they crept up another step;
&ldquo;Sylvia, will you always think of me just here on this
step, as you go up to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvia, &ldquo;that I will.&nbsp; And,
Katie, would it be wrong just to whisper a little prayer then
that you might be good and happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be wrong, Sylvia; only couldn&rsquo;t
you just ask, too, for me to come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sylvia thoughtfully,
pausing a long time on the step.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see we know it
is sure to be God&rsquo;s will that you should be good and happy;
but if it was not for you to come home, we might be like Balaam,
you know, if we asked it too much, and it might come about in
some terrible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
And the two little girls parted gravely and peacefully; Kate
somehow feeling as if, though grievous things were before her,
the good little kind Sylvia&rsquo;s hearty prayers must obtain
some good for her.</p>
<p>There is no use in telling how sad the parting was when Mr.
Wardour and the little Countess set out for London again.&nbsp;
Mary had begged hard to go too, thinking that she could plead for
Kate better than anyone else; but Mr. Wardour thought Lady
Barbara more likely to be angered than softened by their clinging
to their former charge; and besides, it was too great an
expense.</p>
<p>He had no doubt of Lady Barbara&rsquo;s displeasure from the
tone of the note that morning received, coldly thanking him and
Miss Wardour for their intelligence, and his promise to restore
Lady Caergwent on Tuesday.&nbsp; She was sorry to trouble him to
bring the child back; she would have come herself, but that her
sister was exceedingly unwell, from the alarm coming at a time of
great family affliction.&nbsp; If Lady Caergwent were not able to
return on Tuesday, she would send down her own maid to bring her
home on Wednesday.&nbsp; The letter was civility itself; but it
was plain that Lady Barbara thought Kate&rsquo;s illness no
better than the &ldquo;previous engagement,&rdquo; in the note
that never was written.</p>
<p>What was the family affliction?&nbsp; Kate could not guess,
but was inclined to imagine privately that Aunt Barbara was
magnifying Uncle Giles&rsquo;s return without being a General
into a family affliction, on purpose to aggravate her
offence.&nbsp; However, in the train, Mr. Wardour, who had been
looking at the Supplement of the <i>Times</i>, lent to him by a
fellow-traveller, touched her, and made her read&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 11th, at Alexandria, in his 23rd year,
Lieutenant Giles de la Poer Umfraville, of the 109th regiment;
eldest, and last survivor of the children of the Honourable Giles
Umfraville, late Lieutenant-Colonel of the 109th
regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate knew she ought to be very sorry, and greatly pity the
bereaved father and mother; but, somehow, she could not help
dwelling most upon the certainty that everyone would be much more
hard upon her, and cast up this trouble to her, as if she had
known of it, and run away on purpose to make it worse.&nbsp; It
must have been this that they were talking about in Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s room, and this must have made them so slow to detect
her flight.</p>
<p>In due time the train arrived, a cab was taken, and Kate,
beginning to tremble with fright, sat by Mr. Wardour, and held
his coat as if clinging to him as long as she could was a
comfort.&nbsp; Sometimes she wished the cab would go faster, so
that it might be over; sometimes&mdash;especially when the
streets became only too well known to her&mdash;she wished that
they would stretch out and out for ever, that she might still be
sitting by Papa, holding his coat.&nbsp; It seemed as if that
would be happiness enough for life!</p>
<p>Here was Bruton Street; here the door that on Saturday had
shut behind her!&nbsp; It was only too soon open, and Kate kept
her eyes on the ground, ashamed that even the butler should see
her.&nbsp; She hung back, waiting till Mr. Wardour had paid the
cabman; but there was no spinning it out, she had to walk
upstairs, her only comfort being that her hand was in his.</p>
<p>No one was in the drawing-room; but before long Lady Barbara
came in.&nbsp; Kate durst not look up at her, but was sure, from
the tone of her voice, that she must have her very sternest face;
and there was something to make one shiver in the rustle of her
silk dress as she curtsied to Mr. Wardour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought home my little niece,&rdquo; he said,
drawing Kate forward; &ldquo;and I think I may truly say, that
she is very sorry for what has passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause; Kate knew the terrible black eyes were upon
her, but she felt, besides, the longing to speak out the truth,
and a sense that with Papa by her side she had courage to do
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Aunt Barbara,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I was
very self-willed; I ought not to have fancied things, nor said
you used me ill, and wanted me to tell stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart was lighter; though it beat so terribly as
she said those words.&nbsp; She knew that they pleased <i>one</i>
of the two who were present, and she knew they were right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well you should be so far sensible of your
misconduct,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara; but her voice was as dry
and hard as ever, and Mr. Wardour added, &ldquo;She is sincerely
sorry; it is from her voluntary confession that I know how much
trouble she has given you; and I think, if you will kindly
forgive her, that you will find her less self-willed in
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shoved Kate a little forward, squeezing her hand, and
trying to withdraw his own.&nbsp; She perceived that he meant
that she ought to ask pardon; and though it went against her more
than her first speech had done, she contrived to say, &ldquo;I do
beg pardon, Aunt Barbara; I will try to do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pardon is one thing, Katharine,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your sorrow is real, of course I forgive
you;&rdquo; and she took Kate&rsquo;s right-hand&mdash;the left
was still holding by the fingers&rsquo; ends to Mr.
Wardour.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the consequences of such behaviour are
another consideration.&nbsp; My personal pardon cannot, and ought
not, to avert them&mdash;as I am sure you must perceive, Mr.
Wardour,&rdquo; she added, as the frightened child retreated upon
him.&nbsp; Those consequences of Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s were
fearful things!&nbsp; Mr. Wardour said something, to which Kate
scarcely attended in her alarm, and her aunt went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Lady Caergwent&rsquo;s own sake, I shall endeavour
to keep this most unfortunate step as much a secret as
possible.&nbsp; I believe that scarcely anyone beyond this house
is aware of it; and I hope that your family will perceive the
necessity of being equally cautious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour bowed, and assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added Lady Barbara, &ldquo;it has made it
quite impossible for my sister and myself to continue to take the
charge of her.&nbsp; My sister&rsquo;s health has suffered from
the constant noise and restlessness of a child in the house: the
anxiety and responsibility are far too much for her; and in
addition to this, she had such severe nervous seizures from the
alarm of my niece&rsquo;s elopement, that nothing would induce me
to subject her to a recurrence of such agitation.&nbsp; We must
receive the child for the present, of course; but as soon as my
brother returns, and can attend to business, the matter must be
referred to the Lord Chancellor, and an establishment formed,
with a lady at the head, who may have authority and experience to
deal with such an ungovernable nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, &ldquo;under these
circumstances it might be convenient for me to take her home
again for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate quivered with hope; but that was far too good to be true;
Lady Barbara gave a horrid little cough, and there was a sound
almost of offence in her &ldquo;Thank you, you are very kind, but
that would be quite out of the question.&nbsp; I am at present
responsible for my niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardour, as an
excuse for the offer, &ldquo;that as Lady Jane is so unwell, and
Colonel Umfraville in so much affliction, it might be a relief to
part with her at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; again said Lady Barbara, as stiffly
as if her throat were lined with whalebone; &ldquo;no
inconvenience can interfere with my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wardour knew there was no use in saying any more, and
inquired after Lady Jane.&nbsp; She had, it appeared, been very
ill on Saturday evening, and had not since left her room.&nbsp;
Mr. Wardour then said that Kate had not been aware, till a few
hours ago, of the death of her cousin, and inquired anxiously
after the father and mother; but Lady Barbara would not do more
than answer direct questions, and only said that her nephew had
been too much weakened to bear the journey, and had sunk suddenly
at Alexandria, and that his father was, she feared, very
unwell.&nbsp; She could not tell how soon he was likely to be in
England.&nbsp; Then she thanked Mr. Wardour for having brought
Lady Caergwent home, and offered him some luncheon; but in such a
grave grand way, that it was plain that she did not want him to
eat it, and, feeling that he could do no more good, he kissed
poor Kate and wished Lady Barbara good-bye.</p>
<p>Poor Kate stood, drooping, too much constrained by dismay even
to try to cling to him, or run after him to the foot of the
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Katharine,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;come up
with me to your Aunt Jane&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; She has been so
much distressed about you, that she will not be easy till she has
seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate followed meekly; and found Aunt Jane sitting by the fire
in her own room, looking flushed, hot, and trembling.&nbsp; She
held out her arms, and Kate ran into them; but neither of them
dared to speak, and Lady Barbara stood up, saying, &ldquo;She
says she is very sorry, and thus we may forgive her; as I know
you do all the suffering you have undergone on her
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Jane held the child tighter, and Kate returned her kisses
with all her might; but the other aunt said, &ldquo;That will
do.&nbsp; She must not be too much for you again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they let go as if a cold wind had blown between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Wardour bring her home?&rdquo; asked Lady
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and was kind enough to propose taking her back
again,&rdquo; was the answer, with a sneer, that made Kate feel
desperately angry, though she did not understand it.</p>
<p>In truth, Lady Barbara was greatly displeased with the
Wardours.&nbsp; She had always been led to think her
niece&rsquo;s faults the effect of their management; and she now
imagined that there had been some encouragement of the
child&rsquo;s discontent to make her run away; and that if they
had been sufficiently shocked and concerned, the truant would
have been brought home much sooner.&nbsp; It all came of her
having allowed her niece to associate with those children at
Bournemouth.&nbsp; She would be more careful for the future.</p>
<p>Careful, indeed, she was!&nbsp; She had come to think of her
niece as a sort of small wild beast that must never be let out of
sight of some trustworthy person, lest she should fly away
again.</p>
<p>A daily governess, an elderly person, very grave and silent,
came in directly after breakfast, walked with the Countess, and
heard the lessons; and after her departure, Kate was always to be
in the room with her aunts, and never was allowed to sit in the
schoolroom and amuse herself alone; but her tea was brought into
the dining-room while her aunts were at dinner, and morning,
noon, and night, she knew that she was being watched.</p>
<p>It was very bitter to her.&nbsp; It seemed to take all the
spirit away from her, as if she did not care for books, lessons,
or anything else.&nbsp; Sometimes her heart burnt with hot
indignation, and she would squeeze her hands together, or wring
round her handkerchief in a sort of misery; but it never got
beyond that; she never broke out, for she was depressed by what
was still worse, the sense of shame.&nbsp; Lady Barbara had not
said many words, but had made her feel, in spite of having
forgiven her, that she had done a thing that would be a disgrace
to her for ever; a thing that would make people think twice
before they allowed their children to associate with her; and
that put her below the level of other girls.&nbsp; The very pain
that Lady Barbara took to hush it up, her fears lest it should
come to the ears of the De la Poers, her hopes that it
<i>might</i> not be necessary to reveal it to her brother,
assisted to weigh down Kate with a sense of the heinousness of
what she had done, and sunk her so that she had no inclination to
complain of the watchfulness around her.&nbsp; And Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s sorrowful kindness went to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>could</i> you do it, my dear?&rdquo; she said,
in such a wonderful wistful tone, when Kate was alone with
her.</p>
<p>Kate hung her head.&nbsp; She could not think now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so sad,&rdquo; added Lady Jane; &ldquo;I hoped we
might have gone on so nicely together.&nbsp; And now I hope your
Uncle Giles will not hear of it.&nbsp; He would be so shocked,
and never trust you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> will trust me, when I have been good a long
time, Aunt Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I would trust you any time, you know; but then
that&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t judge; and your Aunt
Barbara says, after such lawlessness, you need very experienced
training to root out old associations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the aunts were more shocked than was quite needful and
treated Kate as if she had been older and known better what she
was doing; but they were sincere in their horror at her offence;
and once she even heard Lady Barbara saying to Mr. Mercer that
there seemed to be a doom on the family&mdash;in the loss of the
promising young man&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p>The words were not spoken, but Kate knew that she was this
greatest of all misfortunes to the family.</p>
<p>Poor child!&nbsp; In the midst of all this, there was one
comfort.&nbsp; She had not put aside what Mr. Wardour had told
her about the Comforter she could always have.&nbsp; She
<i>did</i> say her prayers as she had never said them before, and
she looked out in the Psalms and Lessons for comforting
verses.&nbsp; She knew she had done very wrong, and she asked
with all the strength of her heart to be forgiven, and made less
unhappy, and that people might be kinder to her.&nbsp; Sometimes
she thought no help was coming, and that her prayers did no good,
but she went on; and then, perhaps, she got a kind little caress
from Lady Jane, or Mr. Mercer spoke good-naturedly to her, or
Lady Barbara granted her some little favour, and she felt as if
there was hope and things were getting better; and she took
courage all the more to pray that Uncle Giles might not be very
hard upon her, nor the Lord Chancellor very cruel.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">fortnight</span> had passed, and had
seemed nearly as long as a year, since Kate&rsquo;s return from
Oldburgh, when one afternoon, when she was lazily turning over
the leaves of a story-book that she knew so well by heart that
she could go over it in the twilight, she began to gather from
her aunt&rsquo;s words that somebody was coming.</p>
<p>They never told her anything direct; but by listening a little
more attentively to what they were saying, she found out that a
letter&mdash;no, a telegram&mdash;had come while she was at her
lessons; that Aunt Barbara had been taking rooms at a hotel; that
she was insisting that Jane should not imagine they would come
to-night&mdash;they would not come till the last train, and then
neither of them would be equal&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear Emily!&nbsp; But could we not just drive to
the hotel and meet them?&nbsp; It will be so dreary for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go out at night! and for such a meeting! when you
ought to be keeping yourself as quiet as possible!&nbsp; No,
depend upon it they will prefer getting in quietly, and resting
to-night; and Giles, perhaps, will step in to breakfast in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you will bring him up to me at once!&nbsp; I
wonder if the boy is much altered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throb! throb! throb! went Kate&rsquo;s heart!&nbsp; So the
terrible stern uncle was in England, and this was the time for
her to be given up to the Lord Chancellor and all his myrmidons
(a word that always came into her head when she was in a
fright).&nbsp; She had never loved Aunt Jane so well; she almost
loved Aunt Barbara, and began to think of clinging to her with an
eloquent speech, pleading to be spared from the Lord
Chancellor!</p>
<p>To-morrow morning&mdash;that was a respite!</p>
<p>There was a sound of wheels.&nbsp; Lady Jane started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are giving a party next door,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara.</p>
<p>But the bell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a parcel coming home,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray do not be nervous, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the red colour was higher in Barbara&rsquo;s own cheeks,
as there were steps on the stairs; and in quite a triumphant
voice the butler announced, as he opened the door, &ldquo;Colonel
and Mrs. Umfraville!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stood up, and backed.&nbsp; It was Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s
straight, handsome, terrible face, and with a great black
moustache to make it worse.&nbsp; She saw that, and it was all
she feared!&nbsp; She was glad the sofa was between them!</p>
<p>There was a lady besides all black bonnet and cloak; and there
was a confusion of sounds, a little half sobbing of Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s; but the other sister and the brother were quite
steady and grave.&nbsp; It was his keen dark eye, sparkling like
some wild animal&rsquo;s in the firelight, as Kate thought, which
spied her out; and his deep grave voice said, &ldquo;My little
niece,&rdquo; as he held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and speak to your uncle, Katharine,&rdquo; said
Lady Barbara; and not only had she to put her hand into that
great firm one, but her forehead was scrubbed by his
moustache.&nbsp; She had never been kissed by a moustache before,
and she shuddered as if it had been on a panther&rsquo;s lip.</p>
<p>But then he said, &ldquo;There, Emily;&rdquo; and she found
herself folded up in such arms as had never been round her
before, with the very sweetest of kisses on her cheeks, the very
kindest of eyes, full of moisture, gazing at her as if they had
been hungry for her.&nbsp; Even when the embrace was over, the
hand still held hers; and as she stood by the new aunt, a thought
crossed her that had never come before, &ldquo;I wonder if my
mamma was like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some explanation of how the travellers had come on,
&amp;c., and it was settled that they were to stay to dinner;
after which Mrs. Umfraville went away with Lady Barbara to take
off her bonnet.</p>
<p>Colonel Umfraville came and sat down by his sister on the
sofa, and said, &ldquo;Well Jane, how have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! much as usual:&rdquo; and then there was a silence,
till she moved a little nearer to him, put her hand on his arm,
looked up in his face with swimming eyes, and said, &ldquo;O
Giles!&nbsp; Giles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand, and bent over her, saying, in the same grave
steady voice, &ldquo;Do not grieve for us, Jane.&nbsp; We have a
great deal to be thankful for, and we shall do very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made that loving tender-hearted Aunt Jane break quite down,
cling to him and sob, &ldquo;O Giles&mdash;those dear noble
boys&mdash;how little we thought&mdash;and dear Caergwent
too&mdash;and you away from home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was crying quite violently, so as to be shaken by the
sobs; and her brother stood over her, saying a kind word or two
now and then, to try to soothe her; while Kate remained a little
way off, with her black eyes wide open, thinking her
uncle&rsquo;s face was almost displeased&mdash;at any rate, very
rigid.&nbsp; He looked up at Kate, and signed towards a
scent-bottle on the table.&nbsp; Kate gave it; and then, as if
the movement had filled her with a panic, she darted out of the
room, and flew up to the bedrooms, crying out, &ldquo;Aunt
Barbara, Aunt Jane is crying so terribly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will have one of her attacks!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;
began Lady Barbara, catching up a bottle of salvolatile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we not better leave her and Giles to one
another?&rdquo; said the tones that Kate liked so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear, you don&rsquo;t know what these attacks
are!&rdquo; and away hurried Lady Barbara.</p>
<p>The bonnet was off now, leaving only a little plain net cap
under it, round the calm gentle face.&nbsp; There was a great
look of sadness, and the eyelids were heavy and drooping; but
there was something that put Kate in mind of a mother dove in the
softness of the large tender embrace, and the full sweet
caressing tone.&nbsp; What a pity that such an aunt must know
that she was an ill-behaved child, a misfortune to her
lineage!&nbsp; She stood leaning against the door, very awkward
and conscious.&nbsp; Mrs. Umfraville turned round, after
smoothing her hair at the glass, smiled, and said, &ldquo;I
thought I should find you here, my little niece.&nbsp; You are
Kate, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be, but my aunts here call me
Katharine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your little room?&rdquo; said Mrs. Umfraville,
as they came out.&nbsp; The fact was, that she thought the
sisters might be happier with their brother if she delayed a
little; so she came into Kate&rsquo;s room, and was beginning to
look at her books, when Lady Barbara came hurrying up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is composed now, Emily.&nbsp; Oh! it is all right;
I did not know where Katharine might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s colour glowed.&nbsp; She could not bear that this
sweet Aunt Emily should guess that she was a state prisoner, kept
in constant view.</p>
<p>Lady Jane was quiet again, and nothing more that could
overthrow her spirits passed all the evening; there was only a
little murmur of talk, generally going on chiefly between Lady
Barbara and Mrs. Umfraville, though occasionally the others put
in a word.&nbsp; The Colonel sat most of the time with his set,
serious face, and his eye fixed as if he was not attending,
though sometimes Kate found the quick keen brilliance of his look
bent full upon her, so as to terrify her by its suddenness, and
make her hardly know what she was saying or doing.</p>
<p>The worst moments were at dinner.&nbsp; She was, in the first
place, sure that those dark questioning eyes had decided that
there must be some sad cause for her not being trusted to drink
her tea elsewhere; and then, in the pause after the first course,
the eyes came again, and he said, and to her, &ldquo;I hope your
good relations the Wardours are well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; faltered Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you see them last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a fortnight ago&mdash;&rdquo; began Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wardour came up to London for a few hours,&rdquo;
said Lady Barbara, looking at Kate as if she meant to plunge her
below the floor; at least, so the child imagined.</p>
<p>The sense that this was not the whole truth made her
especially miserable; and all the rest of the evening was one
misery of embarrassment, when her limbs did not seem to be her
own, but as if somebody else was sitting at her little table,
walking upstairs, and doing her work.&nbsp; Even Mrs.
Umfraville&rsquo;s kind ways could not restore her; she only hung
her head and mumbled when she was asked to show her work, and did
not so much as know what was to become of her piece of
cross-stitch when it was finished.</p>
<p>There was some inquiry after the De la Poers; and Mrs.
Umfraville asked if she had found some playfellows among their
daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; faintly said Kate; and with another flush
of colour, thought of having been told, that if Lady de la Poer
knew what she had done, she would never be allowed to play with
them again, and therefore that she never durst attempt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were very nice children,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Umfraville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably nice children,&rdquo; returned Lady Barbara,
in a tone that again cut Kate to the heart.</p>
<p>Bed-time came; and she would have been glad of it, but that
all the time she was going to sleep there was the Lord Chancellor
to think of, and the uncle and aunt with the statue faces
dragging her before him.</p>
<p>Sunday was the next day, and the uncle and aunt were not seen
till after the afternoon service, when they came to dinner, and
much such an evening as the former one passed; but towards the
end of it Mrs. Umfraville said, &ldquo;Now, Barbara, I have a
favour to ask.&nbsp; Will you let this child spend the day with
me to-morrow?&nbsp; Giles will be out, and I shall be very glad
to have her for my companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s eyes glistened, and she thought of stern
Proserpine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Emily, you do not know what you ask.&nbsp; She
will be far too much for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Umfraville, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know about trusting her.&nbsp; I
cannot go out, and Jane cannot spare Bartley so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come and fetch her,&rdquo; said the Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bring her back too.&nbsp; I will send the carriage
in the evening, but do not let her come without you,&rdquo; said
Lady Barbara earnestly.</p>
<p>Had they told, or would they tell after she was gone to
bed?&nbsp; Kate thought Aunt Barbara was a woman of her word, but
did not quite trust her.&nbsp; Consent was given; but would not
that stern soldier destroy all the pleasure?&nbsp; And people in
sorrow too!&nbsp; Kate thought of Mrs. Lacy, and had no very
bright anticipations of her day; yet a holiday was something, and
to be out of Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s way a great deal more.</p>
<p>She had not been long dressed when there was a ring at the
bell, and, before she had begun to expect him, the tall man with
the dark lip and grey hair stood in her schoolroom.&nbsp; She
gave such a start, that he asked, &ldquo;Did you not expect me so
soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think you would come till after breakfast:
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with an impulse of running away from his dread presence,
she darted off to put on her hat, but was arrested on the way by
Lady Barbara, at her bedroom door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Giles is come for me,&rdquo; she said, and would
have rushed on, but her aunt detained her to say,
&ldquo;Recollect, Katharine, that wildness and impetuosity, at
all times unbecoming, are particularly so where there is
affliction.&nbsp; If consideration for others will not influence
you, bear in mind that on the impression you make on your uncle
and aunt, it depends whether I shall be obliged to tell all that
I would willingly forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s heart swelled, and without speaking she entered
her own room, thinking how hard it was to have even the pleasure
of hoping for ease and enjoyment taken away.</p>
<p>When she came down, she found her aunt&mdash;as she
believed&mdash;warning her uncle against her being left to
herself; and then came, &ldquo;If she should be too much for
Emily, only send a note, and Bartley or I will come to fetch her
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants him to think me a little wild beast!&rdquo;
thought Kate; but her uncle answered, &ldquo;Emily always knows
how to deal with children.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To deal with children!&nbsp; What did that mean?&rdquo;
thought the Countess, as she stepped along by the side of her
uncle, not venturing to speak, and feeling almost as shy and
bewildered as when she was on the world alone.</p>
<p>He did not speak, but when they came to a crossing of a main
street, he took her by the hand; and there was something
protecting and comfortable in the feel, so that she did not let
go; and presently, as she walked on, she felt the fingers close
on hers with such a quick tight squeeze, that she looked up in a
fright and met the dark eye turned on her quite soft and
glistening.&nbsp; She did not guess how he was thinking of little
clasping hands that had held there before; and he only said
something rather hurriedly about avoiding some coals that were
being taken in through a round hole in the pavement.</p>
<p>Soon they were at the hotel; and Mrs. Umfraville came out of
her room with that greeting which Kate liked so much, helped her
to take off her cloak and smooth her hair, and then set her down
to breakfast.</p>
<p>It was a silent meal to Kate.&nbsp; Her uncle and aunt had
letters to read, and things to consult about that she did not
understand; but all the time there was a kind watch kept up that
she had what she liked; and Aunt Emily&rsquo;s voice was so much
like the deep notes of the wood-pigeons round Oldburgh, that she
did not care how long she listened to it, even if it had been
talking Hindostanee!</p>
<p>As soon as breakfast was over, the Colonel took up his hat and
went out; and Mrs. Umfraville said, turning to Kate, &ldquo;Now,
my dear, I have something for you to help me in; I want to unpack
some things that I have brought home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall like that!&rdquo; said Kate, feeling as if
a weight was gone with the grave uncle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Umfraville rang, and asked to have a certain box brought
in.&nbsp; Such a box, all smelling of choice Indian wood; the
very shavings that stuffed it were delightful!&nbsp; And what an
unpacking!&nbsp; It was like nothing but the Indian stall at the
Baker Street Bazaar!&nbsp; There were two beautiful large ivory
work-boxes, inlaid with stripes and circles of tiny mosaic; and
there were even more delicious little boxes of soft fragrant
sandal wood, and a set of chessmen in ivory.&nbsp; The kings were
riding on elephants, with canopies over their heads, and ladders
to climb up by; and each elephant had a tiger in his trunk.&nbsp;
Then the queens were not queens, but grand viziers, because the
queen is nobody in the East: and each had a lesser elephant; the
bishops were men riding on still smaller elephants; the castles
had camels, the knights horses; and the pawns were little
foot-soldiers, the white ones with guns, as being European
troops, the red ones with bows and arrows.&nbsp; Kate was
perfectly delighted with these men, and looked at and admired
them one by one, longing to play a game with them.&nbsp; Then
there was one of those wonderful clusters of Chinese ivory balls,
all loose, one within the other, carved in different patterns of
network, and there were shells spotted and pink-mouthed,
card-cases, red shining boxes, queer Indian dolls; figures in all
manner of costumes, in gorgeous colours, painted upon shining
transparent talc or on soft rice-paper.&nbsp; There was no
describing how charming the sight was, nor how Kate dwelt upon
each article; and how pleasantly her aunt explained what it was
intended for, and where it came from, answering all questions in
the nicest, kindest way.&nbsp; When all the wool and shavings had
been pinched, and the curled-up toes of the slippers explored, so
as to make sure that no tiny shell nor ivory carving lurked
unseen, the room looked like a museum; and Mrs. Umfraville said,
&ldquo;Most of these things were meant for our home friends:
there is an Indian scarf and a Cashmere shawl for your two aunts,
and I believe the chessmen are for Lord de la Poer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Aunt Emily, I should so like to play one game with
them before they go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have one with you, if you can be very careful of
their tender points,&rdquo; said Mrs. Umfraville, without one of
the objections that Kate had expected; &ldquo;but first I want
you to help me about some of the other things.&nbsp; Your uncle
meant one of the work-boxes for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Aunt Emily, how delightful!&nbsp; I really will work,
with such a dear beautiful box!&rdquo; cried Kate, opening it,
and again peeping into all its little holes and
contrivances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the very place for a dormouse
to sleep in!&nbsp; And who is the other for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Fanny de la Poer, who is his godchild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&nbsp; Fanny always has such nice
pretty work about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I want you to help me to choose the other
presents.&nbsp; There; these,&rdquo; pointing to a scarf and a
muslin dress adorned with the wings of diamond beetles,
&ldquo;are for some young cousins of my own; but you will be able
best to choose what the other De la Poers and your cousins at
Oldburgh would like best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousins at Oldburgh!&rdquo; cried Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;May they have some of these pretty things?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as her aunt answered &ldquo;We hope they will,&rdquo; Kate
flew at her, and hugged her quite tight round the throat; then,
when Mrs. Umfraville undid the clasp, and returned the kiss, she
went like an India-rubber ball with a backward bound, put her
hands together over her head, and gasped out, &ldquo;Oh, thank
you, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t go quite mad.&nbsp; You will jump
into that calabash, and then it won&rsquo;t be fit for
anybody.&nbsp; Are you so very glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! so glad!&nbsp; Pretty things do come so seldom to
Oldburgh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we thought you might like to send Miss Wardour
this shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a beautiful heavy shawl of the soft wool of the
Cashmere goats; really of every kind of brilliant hue, but so
dexterously blended together, that the whole looked dark and
sober.&nbsp; But Kate did not look with favour on the shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shawl is so stupid,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you please, I had rather Mary had the work-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the work-box is for Lady Fanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I meant my own,&rdquo; said Kate
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you only knew what a pity it is to
give nice things to me; they always get into such a mess.&nbsp;
Now, Mary always has her things so nice; and she works so
beautifully; she has never let Lily wear a stitch but of her
setting; and she always wished for a box like this.&nbsp; One of
her friends at school had a little one; and she used to say, when
we played at roe&rsquo;s egg, that she wanted nothing but an
ivory work-box; and she has nothing but an old blue one, with the
steel turned black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hear what your uncle says, for you must know
that he meant the box for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t care for it,&rdquo;
said Kate, with a sudden glistening in her eyes; &ldquo;it is
because I do care for it so very much that I want Mary to have
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is, my dear;&rdquo; and her aunt kissed her;
&ldquo;but we must think about it a little.&nbsp; Perhaps Mary
would not think an Indian shawl quite so stupid as you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary isn&rsquo;t a nasty vain conceited girl!&rdquo;
cried Kate indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She always looks nice; but I
heard Papa say her dress did not cost much more than
Sylvia&rsquo;s and mine, because she never tore anything, and
took such care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Umfraville, perhaps
not entirely convinced that the shawl would not be a greater
prize to the thrifty girl than Kate perceived.</p>
<p>Kate meanwhile had sprung unmolested on a beautiful sandalwood
case for Sylvia, and a set of rice-paper pictures for Lily; and
the appropriating other treasures to the De la Poers, packing
them up, and directing them, accompanied with explanations of
their habits and tastes, lasted till so late, that after the
litter was cleared away there was only time for one game at chess
with the grand pieces; and in truth the honour of using them was
greater than the pleasure.&nbsp; They covered up the board, so
that there was no seeing the squares, and it was necessary to be
most inconveniently cautious in lifting them.&nbsp; They were
made to be looked at, not played with; and yet, wonderful to
relate, Kate did not do one of the delicate things a
mischief!</p>
<p>Was it that she was really grown more handy, or was it that
with this gentle aunt she was quite at her ease, yet too much
subdued to be careless and rough?</p>
<p>The luncheon came; and after it, she drove with her aunt first
to a few shops, and then to take up the Colonel, who had been
with his lawyer.&nbsp; Kate quaked a little inwardly, lest it
should be about the Lord Chancellor, and tried to frame a
question on the subject to her aunt; but even the most chattering
little girls know what it is to have their lips sealed by an odd
sort of reserve upon the very matters that make them most uneasy;
and just because her wild imagination had been thinking that
perhaps this was all a plot to waylay her into the Lord
Chancellor&rsquo;s clutches, she could not utter a word on the
matter, while they drove through the quiet squares where lawyers
live.</p>
<p>Mrs. Umfraville, however, soon put that out of her head by
talking to her about the Wardours, and setting open the flood
gates of her eloquence about Sylvia.&nbsp; So delightful was it
to have a listener, that Kate did not grow impatient, long as
they waited at the lawyer&rsquo;s door in the dull square, and
indeed was sorry when the Colonel made his appearance.&nbsp; He
just said to her that he hoped she was not tired of waiting; and
as she replied with a frightened little &ldquo;No, thank
you,&rdquo; began telling his wife something that Kate soon
perceived belonged to his own concerns, not to hers; so she left
off trying to gather the meaning in the rumble of the wheels, and
looked out of window, for she could never be quite at ease when
she felt that those eyes might be upon her.</p>
<p>On coming back to the hotel, Mrs. Umfraville found a note on
the table for her: she read it, gave it to her husband, and said,
&ldquo;I had better go directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it not be too much?&nbsp; Can you?&rdquo; he said
very low; and there was the same repressed twitching of the
muscles of his face, as Kate had seen when he was left with his
sister Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; she said fervently; &ldquo;I shall like
it.&nbsp; And it is her only chance; you see she goes
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage was ordered again, and Mrs. Umfraville explained
to Kate that the note was from a poor invalid lady whose son was
in their own regiment in India, that she was longing to hear
about him, and was going out of town the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall I give you to amuse yourself with, my
dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Umfraville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid we
have hardly a book that will suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate had a great mind to ask to go and sit in the carriage,
rather than remain alone with the terrible black moustache; but
she was afraid of the Colonel&rsquo;s mentioning Aunt
Barbara&rsquo;s orders that she was not to be let out of
sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I
might write to Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her aunt kindly established her at a little table, with a
leathern writing-case, and her uncle mended a pen for her.&nbsp;
Then her aunt went away, and he sat down to his own letters.</p>
<p>Kate durst not speak to him, but she watched him under her
eyelashes, and noticed how he presently laid down his pen, and
gave a long, heavy, sad sigh, such as she had never heard when
his wife was present; then sat musing, looking fixedly at the
grey window; till, rousing himself with another such sigh, he
seemed to force himself to go on writing, but paused again, as if
he were so wearied and oppressed that he could hardly bear
it.</p>
<p>It gave Kate a great awe of him, partly because a little girl
in a book would have gone up, slid her hand into his, and kissed
him; but she could nearly as soon have slid her hand into a
lion&rsquo;s; and she was right, it would have been very
obtrusive.</p>
<p>Some little time had passed before there was an opening of the
door, and the announcement, &ldquo;Lord de la Poer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up started Kate, but she was quite lost in the greeting of the
two friends; Lord de la Poer, with his eyes full of tears,
wringing his friend&rsquo;s hand, hardly able to speak, but just
saying, &ldquo;Dear Giles, I am glad to have you at home.&nbsp;
How is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderfully well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, with the
calm voice but the twitching face.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is gone to
see Mrs. Ducie, the mother of a lad in my regiment, who was
wounded at the same time as Giles, and whom she nursed with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not it very trying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that is a kindness ever is trying to
Emily,&rdquo; he said, and his voice did tremble this time.</p>
<p>Kate had quietly re-seated herself in her chair.&nbsp; She
felt that it was no moment to thrust herself in; nor did she feel
herself aggrieved, even though unnoticed by such a favourite
friend.&nbsp; Something in the whole spirit of the day had made
her only sensible that she was a little girl, and quite forgot
that she was a Countess.</p>
<p>The friends were much too intent on one another to think of
her, as she sat in the recess of the window, their backs to
her.&nbsp; They drew their chairs close to the fire, and began to
talk, bending down together; and Kate felt sure, that as her
uncle at least knew she was there, she need not interrupt.&nbsp;
Besides, what they spoke of was what she had longed to hear, and
would never have dared to ask.&nbsp; Lord de la Poer had been
like a father to his friend&rsquo;s two sons when they were left
in England; and now the Colonel was telling him&mdash;as,
perhaps, he could have told no one else&mdash;about their brave
spirit, and especially of Giles&rsquo;s patience and resolution
through his lingering illness; how he had been entirely unselfish
in entreating that anything might happen rather than that his
father should resign his post; but though longing to be with his
parents, and desponding as to his chance of recovery, had
resigned himself in patience to whatever might be thought right;
and how through the last sudden accession of illness brought on
by the journey, his sole thought had been for his parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has borne up!&rdquo; said Lord de la Poer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As <i>he</i> truly said, &lsquo;As long as she has
anyone to care for, she will never break down.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Luckily, I was entirely knocked up for a few days just at first;
and coming home we had a poor young woman on board very ill, and
Emily nursed her day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you will bring her to Fanny and me to take care
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;another time.&nbsp; But, old fellow, I
don&rsquo;t know whether we either of us could stand your house
full of children yet.&nbsp; Emily would be always among them, and
think she liked it; but I knew how it would be.&nbsp; It was just
so when I took her to a kind friend of ours after the little
girls were taken; she had the children constantly with her, but I
never saw her so ill as she was afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reaction!&nbsp; Well, whenever you please; you shall
have your rooms to yourselves, and only see us when you
like.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t mean to press you; only, what are
you going to do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly tell.&nbsp; There are business matters of
our own, and about poor James&rsquo;s little girl, to keep us
here a little while.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
thought Kate.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must go into our house.&nbsp; I was in hopes
it might be so, and told the housekeeper to make
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; if Emily&mdash;&nbsp; We will see, when she
comes in I want to make up my mind about that child.&nbsp; Have
you seen much of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate began to think honour required her to come forward, but
her heart throbbed with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as I could wish.&nbsp; It is an intelligent
little monkey, and our girls were delighted with her; but I
believe Barbara thinks me a corrupter of youth, for she
discountenances us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! one of the last times I was alone with Giles, he
said, smiling, &lsquo;That little girl in Bruton Street will be
just what Mamma wants;&rsquo; and I know Emily has never ceased
to want to get hold of the motherless thing ever since Mrs.
Wardour&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I know it would be the greatest
comfort to Emily, but I only doubted taking the child away from
my sisters.&nbsp; I thought it would be such a happy thing to
have Jane&rsquo;s kind heart drawn out; and if Barbara had
forgiven the old sore, and used her real admirable good sense
affectionately, it would have been like new life to them.&nbsp;
Besides, it must make a great difference to their income.&nbsp;
But is it possible that it can be the old prejudice, De la
Poer?&nbsp; Barbara evidently dislikes the poor child, and treats
her like a state prisoner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honour prevailed entirely above fear and curiosity.&nbsp; Out
flew Kate, to the exceeding amaze and discomfiture of the two
gentlemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Uncle Giles; it is&mdash;it is
because I ran away!&nbsp; Aunt Barbara said she would not tell,
for if you knew it, you would&mdash;you would despise
me;&mdash;and you,&rdquo; looking at Lord de la Poer,
&ldquo;would never let me play with Grace and Addy
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands&mdash;it was all burning
red; and she was nearly rushing off, but she felt herself lifted
tenderly upon a knee, and an arm round her.&nbsp; She thought it
her old friend; but behold, it was her uncle&rsquo;s voice that
said, in the softest gentlest way, &ldquo;My dear, I never
despise where I meet with truth.&nbsp; Tell me how it was; or had
you rather tell your Aunt Emily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Kate, all her fears
softened by his touch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no! please don&rsquo;t go,
Lord de la Poer; I do want you to know, for I couldn&rsquo;t have
played with Grace and Adelaide on false pretences!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And encouraged by her uncle&rsquo;s tender pressure, she murmured
out, &ldquo;I ran away&mdash;I did&mdash;I went home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Oldburgh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes!&nbsp; It was very wrong;
Papa&mdash;Uncle Wardour, I mean&mdash;made me see it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made you do it?&rdquo; said her uncle
kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not be afraid to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because I was angry.&nbsp; Aunt Barbara would
not let me go to the other Wardours, and wanted me to write
a&mdash;what I thought&mdash;a fashionable falsehood; and when I
said it was a lie,&rdquo; (if possible, Kate here became deeper
crimson than she was before,) &ldquo;she sent me to my room till
I would beg her pardon, and write the note.&nbsp; So&mdash;so I
got out of the house, and took a cab, and went home by the
train.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know it was so very dreadful a thing,
or indeed I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kate hid her burning face on her uncle&rsquo;s breast, and
was considerably startled by what she heard next, from the
Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&nbsp; All I have to say is, that if Barbara had the
keeping of me, I should run away at the end of a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably!&rdquo; and Lord de la Poer saw, what Kate did
not, the first shadow of a smile on the face of his friend, as he
pressed his arm round the still trembling girl; &ldquo;but, you
see, Barbara justly thinks you corrupt youth.&mdash;My little
girl, you must not let <i>him</i> make you think lightly of
this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I never could!&nbsp; Papa was so
shocked!&rdquo; and she was again covered with confusion at the
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added her uncle, &ldquo;it is not as if you
had not gone to older and better friends than any you have ever
had, my poor child.&nbsp; I am afraid you have been much tried,
and have not had a happy life since you left Oldburgh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always been naughty,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must try if your Aunt Emily can help you to be
good.&nbsp; Will you try to be as like her own child to her as
you can, Katharine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to you,&rdquo; actually whispered Kate; for somehow
at that moment she cared much more for the stern uncle than the
gentle aunt.</p>
<p>He lifted her up and kissed her, but set her down again with
the sigh that told how little she could make up to him for the
son he had left in Egypt.&nbsp; Yet, perhaps that sigh made Kate
long with more fervent love for some way of being so very good
and affectionate as quite to make him happy, than if he had
received her demonstration as if satisfied by it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> of note passed during the
rest of the evening.&nbsp; Mrs. Umfraville came home; but Kate
had fallen back into the shy fit that rendered her unwilling to
begin on what was personal, and the Colonel waited to talk it
over with his wife alone before saying any more.</p>
<p>Besides, there were things far more near to them than their
little great-niece, and Mrs. Umfraville could not see Lord de la
Poer without having her heart very full of the sons to whom he
had been so kind.&nbsp; Again they sat round the fire, and this
time in the dark, while once more Giles and Frank and all their
ways were talked over and over, and Kate was forgotten; but she
was not sitting alone in the dark window&mdash;no, she had a
footstool close to her uncle, and sat resting her head upon his
knee, her eyes seeking red caverns in the coals, her heart in a
strange peaceful rest, her ears listening to the mother&rsquo;s
subdued tender tones in speaking of her boys, and the
friend&rsquo;s voice of sympathy and affection.&nbsp; Her uncle
leant back and did not speak at all; but the other two went on
and on, and Mrs. Umfraville seemed to be drinking in every little
trait of her boys&rsquo; English life, not weeping over it, but
absolutely smiling when it was something droll or
characteristic.</p>
<p>Kate felt subdued and reverent, and loved her new relations
more and more for their sorrows; and she began to dream out
castles of the wonderful goodness by which she would comfort
them; then she looked for her uncle&rsquo;s hand to see if she
could dare to stroke it, but one was over his brow, the other out
of reach, and she was shy of doing anything.</p>
<p>The dinner interrupted them; and Kate had the pleasure of
dining late, and sitting opposite to Lord de la Poer, who talked
now and then to her, and told her what Adelaide and Grace were
doing; but he was grave and sad, out of sympathy with his
friends, and Kate was by no means tempted to be foolish.</p>
<p>Indeed, she began to feel that she might hope to be always
good with her uncle and aunt, and that they would never make her
naughty.&nbsp; Only too soon came the announcement of the
carriage for Lady Caergwent; and when Aunt Emily took her into
the bedroom to dress, she clung to that kind hand and fondled
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear little girl!&rdquo; and Aunt Emily held her in
her arms, &ldquo;I am so glad!&nbsp; Kate, I do think your dear
uncle is a little cheered to-night!&nbsp; If having you about him
does him any good, how I shall love you, Katie!&rdquo; and she
hugged her closer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is so kind in Lord de la
Poer to have come!&nbsp; Oh, now he will be better!&nbsp; I am so
thankful he is in England again!&nbsp; You must be with us
whenever Barbara can spare you, Katie dear, for I am sure he
likes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each wants me, to do the other good,&rdquo; thought
Kate; and she was so much touched and pleased that she did not
know what to do, and looked foolish.</p>
<p>Uncle Giles took her down stairs; and when they were in the
carriage, in the dark, he seemed to be less shy: he lifted her on
his knee and said, &ldquo;I will talk to your aunt, and we will
see how soon you can come to us, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let it be soon,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must depend upon your Aunt Barbara,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;and upon law matters, perhaps.&nbsp; And you
must not be troublesome to her; she has suffered very much, and
will not think of herself, so you must think for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how, Uncle Giles,&rdquo; said poor
sincere Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;At home, they always said I had no
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must learn,&rdquo; he said gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is not to be harassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was rather frightened; but he spoke in a kinder
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;At home, you say.&nbsp; Do you mean with my
sisters, or at Oldburgh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at Oldburgh, Uncle Giles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are older now,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and need
not be so childish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please one thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a great choking in her throat, but she did get it
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please, please, don&rsquo;t think all I do
wrong is the Wardours&rsquo; fault!&nbsp; I know I am naughty and
horrid and unladylike, but it is my own own fault, indeed it is,
and nobody <i>else&rsquo;s</i>!&nbsp; Mary and Uncle Wardour
would have made me good&mdash;and it was all my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; and he put the other hand so that he
completely encircled the little slim waist, &ldquo;I do quite
believe that Mr. Wardour taught you all the good you have.&nbsp;
There is nothing I am so glad of as that you love and reverence
him as he deserves&mdash;as far as such a child can do.&nbsp; I
hope you always will, and that your gratitude will increase with
your knowledge of the sacrifices that he made for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too much of a speech for Kate to answer; but she
nestled up to him, and felt as if she loved him more than
ever.&nbsp; He added, &ldquo;I should like to see Mr. Wardour,
but I can hardly leave your aunt yet.&nbsp; Would he come to
London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate gave a gasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; Sylvia said he
would have no money for journeys now!&nbsp; It cost so much his
coming in a first-class carriage with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how necessary it is to learn
consideration,&rdquo; said the Colonel; &ldquo;I must run down to
see him, and come back at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they were at the aunts&rsquo; door, and both
entered the drawing-room together.</p>
<p>Lady Barbara anxiously hoped that Katharine had behaved
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly well,&rdquo; he answered; and his face was
really brighter and tenderer.</p>
<p>It was Kate&rsquo;s bed-time, and she was dismissed at
once.&nbsp; She felt that the kiss and momentary touch of the
hand, with the &ldquo;Bless you,&rdquo; were far more earnest
than the mere greeting kiss.&nbsp; She did not know that it had
been his wonted good-night to his own children.</p>
<p>When she was gone, he took a chair, and explained that he
could remain for a little while, as Lord de la Poer would bear
his wife company.&nbsp; Lady Jane made room for him on the sofa,
and Lady Barbara looked pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to talk to you about that child,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wishing it for some time,&rdquo; said Lady
Barbara; &ldquo;waiting, in fact, to make arrangements till your
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What arrangements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For forming an establishment for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s natural home is with you or with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence; then Lady Jane nervously caught
her brother&rsquo;s hand, saying, &ldquo;O Giles, Giles, you must
not be severe with her, poor little thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be severe, Jane?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What has the child done to deserve it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to enter into particulars,&rdquo; said
Lady Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she is a child who has been so
unfortunately brought up as to require constant watching; and to
have her in the house does so much harm to Jane&rsquo;s health,
that I strongly advise you not to attempt it in Emily&rsquo;s
state of spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would little benefit Emily&rsquo;s spirits to
transfer a duty to a stranger,&rdquo; said the Colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I wish to know why you evidently think so ill of this
girl, Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her entire behaviour since she has been with
us&mdash;&rdquo; began Lady Barbara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generalities only do mischief, Barbara.&nbsp; If I have
any control over this child, I must know facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, Giles,&rdquo; said his sister, distressed
and confused, &ldquo;that I promised the child not to tell you of
her chief piece of misconduct, unless I was compelled by some
fresh fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An injudicious promise, Barbara.&nbsp; You do the child
more harm by implying such an opinion of her than you could do by
letting me hear what she has actually done.&nbsp; But you are
absolved from the promise, for she has herself told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you!&nbsp; That girl has no sense of shame!&nbsp;
After all the pains I took to conceal it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Barbara; it was with the utmost shame that she told
me.&nbsp; It was unguarded of me, I own; but De la Poer and I had
entirely forgotten that she was present, and I asked him if he
could account for your evident dislike and distrust of her.&nbsp;
The child&rsquo;s honourable feelings would not allow her to
listen, and she came forward, and accused herself, not
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Lord de la Poer!&nbsp; Giles, how could you
allow it?&rdquo; cried Lady Barbara, confounded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That whole family will tell the story, and she will be
marked for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De la Poer has some knowledge of child nature,&rdquo;
said the Colonel, slightly smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman often encourages that sort of child, but
condemns her the more.&nbsp; She will be a by-word in that
family!&nbsp; I always knew she would be our disgrace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Giles, do tell Barbara it cannot be so very
bad!&rdquo; entreated Lady Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is such a
child&mdash;poor little dear!&mdash;and so little used to
control!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only as yet heard her own confused
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barbara gave her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;the child was
both accurate and candid.&nbsp; You should be thankful that your
system has not destroyed her sincerity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, dear Giles,&rdquo; pleaded Lady Jane,
&ldquo;you know Barbara did not want her to say what was
false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Colonel: &ldquo;that was a mere
misunderstanding.&nbsp; It is the spirit of distrust
that&mdash;assuming that a child will act dishonourably&mdash;is
likely to drive her to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never distrusted Katharine till she drove me to do
so,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara, with cold, stern composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would never bring an accusation of breach of trust
where I had not made it evident that I reposed confidence,&rdquo;
said the Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara; &ldquo;you
have heard one side.&nbsp; I do not contradict.&nbsp; I know the
girl would not wilfully deceive by word; and I am willing to
confess that I am not capable of dealing with her.&nbsp; Only
from a sense of duty did I ever undertake it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of duty, Barbara?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of duty to the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not see those things in the same light,&rdquo; he
said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought, as you know, that the duty
was more incumbent when the child was left an orphan&mdash;a
burthen on relatives who could ill afford to be charged with
her.&nbsp; Perhaps, Barbara, if you had noticed her <i>then</i>,
instead of waiting till circumstances made her the head of our
family, you might have been able to give her that which has been
wanting in your otherwise conscientious
training&mdash;affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barbara held up her head, stiffly, but she was very near
tears, of pain and wounded pride; but she would not defend
herself; and she saw that even her faithful Jane did not feel
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came home, Barbara,&rdquo; continued the Colonel,
&ldquo;resolving that&mdash;much as I wished for Emily&rsquo;s
sake that this little girl should need a home with us&mdash;if
you had found in her a new interest and delight, and were in
her&mdash;let me say it, Barbara&mdash;healing old sores, and
giving her your own good sense and high principle, I would not
say one word to disturb so happy a state of things.&nbsp; I come
and find the child a state prisoner, whom you are endeavouring by
all means to alienate from the friends to whom she owes a
daughter&rsquo;s gratitude; I find her not complaining of you,
but answering me with the saddest account a child can give of
herself&mdash;she is always naughty.&nbsp; After this, Barbara, I
can be doing you no injury in asking you to concur with me in
arrangements for putting the child under my wife&rsquo;s care as
soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, if you like,&rdquo; said Lady Barbara.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I took her only from a sense of duty; and it has half
killed Jane.&nbsp; I would not keep her upon any
consideration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Barbara, it has not hurt me.&mdash;O Giles, she will
always be so anxious about me; it is all my fault for being
nervous and foolish!&rdquo; cried Lady Jane, with quivering
voice, and tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it had not been for
that, we could have made her so happy, dear little spirited
thing.&nbsp; But dear Barbara spoils me, and I know I give way
too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will keep you awake all night!&rdquo; said
Barbara, as the Colonel&rsquo;s tender gesture agitated Jane
more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, Giles, you should have chosen a better
moment for this conversation&mdash;on almost your first arrival
too!&nbsp; But the very existence of this child is a
misfortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us trust that in a few years she may give you
reason to think otherwise,&rdquo; said the Colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you mean what you said&mdash;that you wished us to
take her to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to incommode Emily.&nbsp; She can go on as she has
done till your plans are made.&nbsp; You do not know what a child
she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emily shall come and settle with you to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Colonel Umfraville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not yet spoken to
her, but I think she will wish to have the child with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will be patient with her.&nbsp; You will make
her happy,&rdquo; said Lady Jane, holding his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is made happy by Emily,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But has she spirits for the charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has always spirits enough to give happiness to
others,&rdquo; he answered; and the dew was on his dark
lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Giles&mdash;you will not be severe even if the
poor child is a little wild?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are thinking of, Jane,&rdquo; he said
kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But indeed, my dear, such a wife as mine,
and such sorrows as she has helped me to bear, would have been
wasted indeed, if by God&rsquo;s grace they had not made me less
exacting and impatient than I used to be.&mdash;Barbara,&rdquo;
he added after a pause, &ldquo;I beg your pardon if I have spoken
hastily, or done you injustice.&nbsp; All you have done has been
conscientious; and if I spoke in displeasure&mdash;you know how
one&rsquo;s spirit is moved by seeing a child unhappy&mdash;and
my training in gentleness is not as complete as it ought to be, I
am sorry for the pain I gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barbara was struggling with tears she could not repress;
and at last she broke quite down, and wept so that Lady Jane
moved about in alarm and distress, and her brother waited in some
anxiety.&nbsp; But when she spoke it was humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, Giles.&nbsp; It was not in me to love
that child.&nbsp; It was wrong in me.&nbsp; Perhaps if I had
overcome the feeling when you first told me of it, when her
mother died, it would have been better for us all.&nbsp; Now it
is too late.&nbsp; Our habits have formed themselves, and I can
neither manage the child nor make her happy.&nbsp; It is better
that she should go to you and Emily.&nbsp; And, Giles, if you
still bring her to us sometimes, I will try&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
The last words were lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; he said affectionately, &ldquo;when
there are no more daily collisions.&nbsp; Dear Barbara, if I am
particularly anxious to train this poor girl up at once in
affection and in self-restraint, it is because my whole
life&mdash;ever since I grew up&mdash;has taught me what a
grievous task is left us, after we are our own masters.&nbsp; If
our childish faults&mdash;such as impetuosity and
sullenness&mdash;are not corrected on principle, not for
convenience, while we are children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this conversation, everyone will be sure that Mrs.
Umfraville came next day, and after many arrangements with Lady
Barbara, carried off the little Countess with her to the house
that Lord de la Poer had lent them.</p>
<p>Kate was subdued and quiet.&nbsp; She felt that she had made a
very unhappy business of her life with her aunts, and that she
should never see Bruton Street without a sense of shame.&nbsp;
Lady Barbara, too, was more soft and kind than she had ever seen
her; and Aunt Jane was very fond of her, and grieved over her not
having been happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, Aunt Jane; it was all my
naughtiness.&nbsp; I know Aunt Emily will make me good; and
nobody could behave ill in the house with Uncle Giles, could they
now?&nbsp; So I shall be sure to be happy.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, Aunt Jane; some day you shall come to stay with
us, and then I&rsquo;ll drive you out in a dear delicious open
carriage, with two prancing ponies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when she wished her other aunt good-bye, she eased her
mind by saying, &ldquo;Aunt Barbara, I am very sorry I was such a
horrid plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were faults on both sides, Katharine,&rdquo; her
aunt answered with dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps in time we may
understand one another better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing Katharine heard when she had left the house
with Mrs. Umfraville was, that her uncle had gone down to
Oldburgh by an early train, and that both box and shawl had gone
with him.</p>
<p>But when he came back late to Lord de la Poer&rsquo;s house,
whom had he brought with him?</p>
<p>Mary!&nbsp; Mary Wardour herself!&nbsp; He had, as a great
favour, begged to have her for a fortnight in London, to take
care of her little cousin, till further arrangements could be
made; and to talk over with Mrs. Umfraville the child&rsquo;s
character, and what would be good for her.</p>
<p>If there was one shy person in the house that night, there was
another happier than words could tell!</p>
<p>Moreover, before very long, the Countess of Caergwent had
really seen the Lord Chancellor, and found him not so very unlike
other people after all; indeed, unless Uncle Giles had told her,
she never would have found out who he was!&nbsp; And when he
asked her whether she would wish to live with Colonel Umfraville
or with Lady Barbara and Lady Jane, it may be very easily guessed
what answer she made!</p>
<p>So it was fixed that she should live at Caergwent Castle with
her uncle and aunt, and be brought up to the care of her own
village and poor people, and to learn the duties of her station
under their care.</p>
<p>And before they left London, Mrs. Umfraville had chosen a very
bright pleasant young governess, to be a friend and companion, as
well as an instructress.&nbsp; Further, it was settled that as
soon as Christmas was over, Sylvia should come for a long visit,
and learn of the governess with Kate.</p>
<p>Those who have learned to know Countess Kate can perhaps guess
whether she found herself right in thinking it impossible to be
naughty near Uncle Giles or Aunt Emily.&nbsp; But of one thing
they may be sure&mdash;that Uncle Giles never failed to make her
truly sorry for her naughtiness, and increasingly earnest in the
struggle to leave it off.</p>
<p>And as time went on, and occupations and interests grew up
round Colonel and Mrs. Umfraville, and their niece lost her
childish wildness, and loved them more and more, they felt their
grievous loss less and less, and did not so miss the vanished
earthly hope.&nbsp; Their own children had so lived that they
could feel them safe; and they attached themselves to the child
in their charge till she was really like their own.</p>
<p>Yet, all the time, Kate still calls Mr. Wardour
&ldquo;Papa;&rdquo; and Sylvia spends half her time with
her.&nbsp; Some people still say that in manners, looks, and
ways, Sylvia would make a better Countess than Lady Caergwent;
but there are things that both are learning together, which alone
can make them fit for any lot upon earth, or for the better
inheritance in Heaven.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
